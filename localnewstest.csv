SNV which partnered with BASF for this particular project is said to receive high quality red onion seeds, to which it will then distribute to small holders farmers in conflict and drought affected areas, through its Horti-LIFE program that works with the Ministry of Agriculture on establishing Farmer Field Schools (FFS).
This week, BASF handed over to SNV the high quality onion seeds to which each participating family will receive seeds for 0.1hectare of onions allowing them to restart production in the conflict and drought affected areas. The produce is said to be primarily for home consumption, and will allow farming families to restart their livelihoods. The collaboration between SNV and BASF will enable the farmers to produce in total 15 million kilograms of onions thereby increasing the supply to local rural markets.
To make this happen, BASF is offering Nunhems®Santire F1 onion seeds to SNV Ethiopia who will distribute the seeds free of charge to farmers in Tigray and East Amhara. On top of offering the seeds, BASF, as part of its social engagement, has doubled its efforts by donating the same amount of seeds for free to the SNV Farmer Field School program.
“We’re not only active in the vegetable seeds business in Ethiopia, but also strongly committed to the communities and society with different social engagement activities,” said Ben Depraetere, Managing Director of BASF’s vegetable seeds business in Ethiopia.
“We are proud to work together with SNV and join forces to support thousands of small holder farming families in the North of Ethiopia allowing them to restart their livelihoods,” BASF’s MD explained.
“SNV likes to acknowledge the very generous contribution of BASF. We know their seeds to be of high quality due to our cooperation on Zonal Variety Demonstrations that we organize every year with all horticultural seed importers. The seeds fit very well in our Horti-LIFE program that has been promoting horticultural hybrid seeds via FFS,” explained Julie Graham, SNV Ethiopia Country Director.
Since 2016 SNV has worked with the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture to establish the FFS. Its members over the years have learnt about Good Agricultural Practices by observing and discussing the impact of an innovation package (of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and other technologies) that is piloted on small learning plots inside the regular fields of elected lead farmers. This has accordingly enabled the farmers to improve their productivity.
As survey in 2021 showed, FFS members got 34% higher yields, and 43% higher incomes. In concrete numbers: Farmer Field Schools, members earn US$ 545 more from 0.6 ha. At present SNV-Horti-LIFE operates in 81 woredas (districts) reaching 40, 000 farmers per year via 1,300 FFS."

2,Wild Coffee Ethiopia widens horizon to Kenya,https://www.capitalethiopia.com/2023/06/26/wild-coffee-ethiopia-widens-horizon-to-kenya/,06-26-2023,"Wild Coffee Ethiopia, the top tier coffee bean roaster and exporter, announces it will open its first international tasting house in Nairobi.The company which was among the winners of the 2023 Africa Food Awards held in Nairobi, Kenya on June 16 at Safari Park Hotel, through its CEO Gezahegn Mamo, affirmed that it will go global through its first ever branch in the neighboring country.Wild Coffee which is a pioneer for the sale of value added export coffee via its high standard coffee house, locally, at foreign currency, has built a high reputation for its premium products. As a result it has drawn in a global customer base and played a major role in promoting Ethiopia’s value added coffee besides the traditional and well popular high quality green bean.The product is one of the few popular Ethiopian value added coffee commodities offered on prominent worldwide ecommerce platforms.The 2023 edition of the Africa Food Awards, which have become sub-Saharan Africa’s most respected food industry Awards – since the first edition in 2017, has welcomed more than 100 entries from across Africa. With the main categories and sub-categories – indicating the growing influence of the Awards, the young start-ups, national and regional giants and multi-nationals operating in the Continent vied for a place to be celebrated at the Awards.Winning at the stage for the first time for Ethiopia was Wild Coffee Ethiopia (Fresh Agro Industry PLC) which was awarded as one of the four companies under the category of ‘Rising Star African Food Company of the Year’.Over 50 African companies received different awards in various categories at the recognition ceremony.As Gezahegn highlights, this was no small feat, underlining that such a big award is vital for Ethiopia, “Global coffee companies who source the green bean from Ethiopia have been those who were recognized and awarded on international stages. Now when a local company sources its own commodity and puts the standard value addition and becomes recognized on a similar stage, it has a big implication for other similar companies and exporters who engage on value addition besides traditional routes.”“It will also encourage other local companies to boost their standards to become internationally recognized businesses,” he told Capital.“The ‘Wild Blend’, a mix of different Ethiopian coffee varieties, has got high acceptance from global consumers who mainly access it through Alibaba, Amazon and Wal-Mart.

3,IATA calls on Gov’t to clear blocked airline funds,https://www.capitalethiopia.com/2023/06/26/iata-calls-on-govt-to-clear-blocked-airline-funds/,06-26-2023,"The global trade association of airlines, International Air Transport Association (IATA), commends the strong recovery of Ethiopian airlines from the COVID-19 crisis which has been integral in enhancing regional connectivity in continent. The association also called on the government of Ethiopia to act swiftly to clear the 95 million dollars in airline funds blocked from repatriation to ensure the country’s connectivity.
IATA which held a two day ‘Focus Africa’ conference in Addis Ababa on June 21-22 saw the conference bringing together airline CEOs along with aviation leaders, decision makers and influencers from Africa, the Middle East and the globe, who converged to collaboratively drive the advancement of aviation in Africa.
The conference focused on six priorities including: strengthening aviation’s contribution to the continent’s economic and social development, improving connectivity, safety and reliability for passengers and shippers.
As indicated at the meeting, Ethiopian airline’s regional connectivity in the continent stood at 113% of pre-crisis levels. According to IATA’s Connectivity Index and Passenger traffic originating from Ethiopia tracked at 19% above pre-crisis levels in the first quarter of 2023.
“Ethiopia’s aviation industry is set to triple by 2040, with an average 6% growth in passenger traffic over the next 17 years,” said Willy Walsh, General Director of the IATA.
“Ethiopian Airlines is performing very well. Our current performance, in all parameters, indicates that our success will continue strong. We have recovered well from the impacts of the pandemic. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to generate USD6.1 billion, this is a 20% growth compared to our last year’s performance. We will be transporting 13.7 million passengers which is also a 55% increase from same period last year,” said Ethiopian Airlines Group CEO, MesfinTasew“While our operations and milestones continue to be persistent, we still have challenges regarding expatriating our accumulated funds in various countries,
Mesfin stated indicating that the airline is suffering with stranded blocked funds in several countries at over USD180 million.
In complement, IATA’s General Director also called upon the government of Ethiopia to clear airline’s blocked funds stating, “The low allocation of USD to the aviation industry by the Ethiopian Government and Central Bank means that $95 million in airline funds are blocked in the country. It’s time for the government to work with the industry to resolve this situation quickly.”
At the conference, many strongly argued that the implementation of a single African air transport market will be key to unlocking travel within the continent fostering the growth of sustainable aviation fuel /SAF/.
IATA demanded the Ethiopian government to explore developing and incentivizing SAF production as the country has the potential to become one of the biggest SAF producers with unique feed stocks, vast land area, and significant solar potential providing opportunities for both biomass feed stocks and renewable non-biomass feed stocks like solar and wind power-to-liquid (PtL) solutions.
“The Ethiopian government is uniquely positioned to stimulate SAF production, a move that would not only support the forecast surge in air travel but also trigger substantial job creation and boost the local economy. Ethiopia has the opportunity to take the lead, and in doing so, construct an aviation future that is as sustainable as it is successful,” said Walsh.
IATA has also launched the Collaborative Aviation Safety Improvement Program (CASIP) to reduce the accident and serious incident rate across Africa as part of the Focus Africa initiative.
Launch partners in the program are said to be: The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), The African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Boeing, and the Airlines Association of Southern Africa (AASA).
Together, the CASIP partners will prioritize the most pressing safety concerns on the continent and rally the resources needed to address them. The benefits of improving aviation safety in Africa will be spread across the economies and societies of the continent.
“CASIP will make it clear to governments across the continent that aviation must be prioritized as an integral part of national development strategies. With such broad benefits at stake, we hope that other parties will be encouraged to join the CASIP effort,” IATA’s Director General stated.
Over the next 15 years, African passengers’ traffic is expected to double with the greatest potential and opportunity. However, infrastructure constraints, high cost, lack of connectivity, regulatory impediments, slow adoption of global standards and skill shortage are some limitation hindering the growth of the sector in the continent."
