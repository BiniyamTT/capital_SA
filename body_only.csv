"regional and federal government officials as well as eritrean soldiers were involved in the theft of food aid in northern ethiopia’s tigray region, the head of an investigation by the tigrayan authorities said on thursday.
the u.n. world food programme and the u.s. agency for international development (usaid) paused food distribution last month in war-scarred tigray because they said significant amounts of aid had been stolen.
the two agencies then suspended food aid across all of ethiopia last week for the same reason. an internal humanitarian memo said usaid believes food has been diverted to ethiopian military units as part of a scheme orchestrated by federal and regional government entities.
more than 20 million people need food assistance in africa’s second most populous nation, largely due to the horn of africa’s worst drought in decades and a two-year civil war in tigray that ended in a truce last november.
general fiseha kidanu, the head of peace and security in tigray’s interim regional administration, told tigrai tv on wednesday that the investigation he leads had confirmed the theft of more than 860 kg of wheat and 215,000 litres of food oil.
investigators have identified 186 suspects involved in the scheme and detained seven, he said, without naming any.
last week ethiopia’s government said in a joint statement with usaid that it was committed to addressing the “deeply concerning revelations of food aid diversion”.
due to conflict and drought, around 20 million people in ethiopia depend on food aid, 16 percent of the total population, the un’s humanitarian agency ocha said in may.
ethiopia hosts nearly one million refugees, mostly from south sudan, somalia and eritrea.
nearly 30,000 fleeing the recent conflict in sudan have since mid-april found refuge in the country.
rebel fighters in tigray began demobilising last month, marking a new stage in the implementation of a peace deal signed by the federal government and regional authorities.
the two-year war in africa’s second most populous country killed untold numbers of civilians and forced about two million from their homes before it ended with a surprise truce in november last year.
on thursday, the ethiopian foreign ministry reiterated that an investigation would be carried out at national level into the aid scandal.
ethiopia’s army has denied its forces benefited from any stolen food aid.
eritrean forces fought alongside ethiopia’s army in the tigray conflict, which killed tens of thousands of people and left hundreds of thousands facing famine-like conditions. (compiled from agencies)"
"the ministry of finance (mof), which earlier this year signaled the ruthless focus of a budget that takes into account internal resources, has proposed a budget fairly close to last year, which has now been approved by the council of ministers (com), awaiting ratification from parliament.
as per the announcement of com, the 2023/24 budget will be 801.6 billion birr, which is about 1.9 percent higher in contrast to the approved budget for the 2022/23 budget year.
unlike previous years, which spotted double digit increment, the new proposal is a bit leaner.
in consideration of foreign currency conversion, the latest budget proposal in comparison to the presiding one is lesser than the amount approved for the budget year that will end on july 7, 2023.
in different occasions, officials from mof had been stating that the coming year’s budget allocation will mainly concentrate on local resources unlike the usual flow from international support and loans.
prior to the budget proposal hearing, in a meeting with budgetary offices that was held on march 15, finance minister, ahmed shide, told participants that in the coming budget year, the government will focus on debt payment. he added that in the 2023/24 budget year, new capital projects will not be launched and strong controlling mechanism will be emplaced on the recurrent budget.
“in their budget preparation, the budgetary offices will consider the resource on hand rather than imagining foreign grants and loans,” he underlined.
from the proposed 801.6 billion birr, 369.6 billion birr will be recurrent budget that has slight increment compared with 347.1 billion birr that was allocated for the 2022/23 budget year.
however, the capital budget allocation has unusually reduced against the preceding year’s amount.
the capital budget expenditure proposal for the coming budget year is almost 204 billion birr that is about 14.2 billion birr lower than the amount ratified for the current budget year.
the subsidy appropriation to regions and support for achievement of sustainable development goals is set to be 214 billion birr and 14 billion birr respectively.
in this ending 2022/23 budget year, the government approved 786.6 billion birr, while on his nine months report, ahmed shide, told parliament that some of the expected resources included on the budget document were not congruent as the resources that were expected from partners did not flow.
thus, the government has been forced to reschedule some of the projects for coming years.
for this coming year, mof informed budgetary offices to be vigilant on their budget request.
it is well known that following the deterioration of budgetary support from external partners in the last couple of years, the central government had resorted to alternative policies like using domestic sources to bridge its budget gap.
as the finance minister explained on his nine month report about a couple of weeks ago, despite relations with foreign partners now bouncing back owing to the peace agreement signed in pretoria, south africa between the government and tplf, the external financial support is yet to improve.
ahmed further cited that the financial support and credit from the world bank is taking the biggest portion, while there are several agreements and commitments with partners to provide financial access.
in his address, the minister applauded the support of the world bank and highlighted that due to dry flow from external finance, the government had reluctantly resorted to using local sources like direct advance (da) and treasury bill (t-bill).
cognizant of this, the minister underscored that this year’s budget gave a priority for completion of projects, debt servicing, reconstruction of war damaged infrastructures and service facilities including aid, and fertilizer subsidy.
the budget allocation for defense has reduced by almost 40.5 percent or 34 billion birr compared with the 2022/23 budget allocation, perhaps in consideration of the peace agreement in connection with the northern conflict.
debt servicing budget allocation on the other hand expanded by 26.3 percent or 33.2 billion birr compared with this year budget. the top budget allocation for central government goes to debt settlement with 159.2 billion birr or 27.8 percent of the total central government budget, road 68.4 billion birr with almost 12 percent share and education at 56 billion birr with 9.7 percent total share.
on the budget year, grants and soft loans from partners have been included with a small portion on the budget preparation.
ahmed said that the budget deficit is largely filled by treasury bills and treasury bond that is introduced in the mid of this budget year.
on his speech the ministers said that in the coming year direct advance will have heavy reduction.
in the budget year, a total of 520.6 billion birr revenue that includes foreign grants is expected to be generated that would have about 28 percent increment with a tax share of 440.8 billion and a non-tax revenue of 38.7 billion birr. both these figures are noted to have over 92 percent of the total revenue. for the year, 6.3 billion birr in direct budget support and 34.8 billion birr in project grants are expected to flow.
the gross budget deficit for the year will be 2.48 percent of the gdp coming in at 281 billion birr. the budget deficit has shown reduction in terms of the share of gdp when compared to the 2022/23 budget year of 3.4 percent, while the recommended share remains less than three percent.
for the budget deficit, 242 billion birr will be covered from domestic source while the remaining 39 billion birr is expected to be covered by foreign loans.
according to ahmed, 53.7 billion birr of the gross budget deficit will be allocated for local and foreign debt settlement.
regarding tax policy, reforms will be applied on vat, excise tax proclamation, and introduction of excise tax stamp and social welfare development duty, which will be introduced on all import items.
according to his speech as of the end of the 2021/22 budget year the per capita income has reached usd 1,218 while efforts are still needed to expand the economic growth as per the ten year development plan. he added that different shocks that occurred in the past years have been the reason for to run beyond the development plan.
in the current 2022/23 budget year, the economy is expected to attain 7.5 percent growth while for the coming year 7.9 percent is projected."
"kaspersky global research and analysis team indicate ethiopia is becoming a hotbed for cyber attackers.
according to amin hasbini, head of meta research center –kaspersky global research and analysis team, exploits on abuse of software vulnerabilities or weaknesses that are leveraged by attackers to gain unauthorized access, control systems, or execute malicious code are on a rise, through ransomware, a malicious software that encrypts victims’ files or systems, demanding a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.
as the analyst enlightened, specifically in april and may 2023, traces from kaspersky global research underground monitoring, pointed out a hacker team called mysterious team bangladesh (mtb) which targeted the online services of at least 10 ethiopian governmental, energy and banking institutions which distributed denial of service attacks.
amin indicated that different and varied cyber-attacks have been witnessed in ethiopia, from traditional cybercriminal gangs, to advanced attacker groups through cloud computing which has targeted the country multiple times in the past few years.
“some of these attacks were found to be sourced from the region while some were global,” stated amin.
a data conducted by kaspersky global research showed in 2023 alone, ethiopia witnessed about 18,000 attacks and 30,000 ransomware.
“these attacks can take down the online services of entities, blocking users and clients from accessing them, sometimes for hours and up to days or week,” amin elaborated.
other underground traces pointing to ethiopian organizations and users being targeted with different kinds of cyber threats, such as ransomware, personal data theft or data leaks, have also been seen.
“many cyber-attacks stay hidden or go unnoticed, it’s hard to estimate the cost incurred. every institution can estimate the cost as a result of being cut out of service and/or having data stolen or leaked. the damage is not limited to financial losses, but extends to reputation and impact on critical infrastructure or national security as well,” opined amin while speaking about ethiopia’s losses to the ruthless cyber attacks.
despite the information network security administration (insa) indicating that it had responded to 4422 cyber-attacks and attempted attacks in the country during the last nine months of the 2022/23 budget year; gaps were seen as 4,272 were accordingly responded to, while 150 caused damage.
kaspersky is a russian multinational cyber-security and anti-virus provider headquartered in moscow, russia, and operated by a holding company in the united kingdom."

"dry conditions are now being expected in the northern parts of the country; warns igad’s climate prediction and applications centre (icpac).
icpac announced that the june to september, 2023 forecast shows high chances of drier than usual conditions across the northern parts of the greater horn of africa (gha).
accordingly, djibouti, eritrea, central and northern ethiopia, western kenya, northern uganda, and much of south sudan and sudan are expected to receive insufficient rainfall until the end of the season.
icpac’s analysis also indicates an increased likelihood of warmer than usual conditions over the entire region, particularly over northern sudan, parts of southern and central to western ethiopia, central and northern kenya, central and northern somalia, and coastal parts of tanzania.
the june to september rainfall season is particularly important for the northern regions of the gha, where it contributes to more than 50 percent of the annual total rainfall.
icpac director, guleid artan called for heightened vigilance, stating, “as the conditions we forecast could very well increase food insecurity in the region. depressed rainfall, coupled with warmer than usual temperatures, are likely to affect crop productivity, with the risk of crop wilting and a hastened decline in pasture and water availability.”
he appealed to igad’s partners to, “stay mobilized and continue to respond to the crisis where 49 million people are still highly-food insecure in the igad region.”
in most parts of the region, above average rainfall was recorded during the march to may, 2023 season, bringing some respite to the communities most affected by five consecutive failed rainfall seasons in parts of ethiopia, kenya, and somalia.
“it is now very likely that we will transition from la niña to el niño between july and september,” explained hussen seid, climate modeling expert at icpac.
“at this stage, there is no indication of the strength or duration of el niño, but in general it is associated with depressed rainfall between june and september in the north of the region and wetter conditions between october and december in the equatorial parts. so, we must get prepared for much wetter weather towards the end of the year. we encourage our users to consult our weekly and monthly updates that have a high degree of predictability,” the climate modeling expert further elaborated.
icpac is a designated regional climate centre by the world meteorological organization."
"the un committee against torture (cat) on friday, may 12, 2023 issued its findings on brazil, colombia, ethiopia, kazakhstan, luxembourg and slovakia after reviewing the six states parties in the latest session.the findings contain the committee’s main concerns and recommendations on each country’s implementation of the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.on ethiopia, the committee said that it was disturbed by reports of summary executions, deliberate attacks on civilian populations, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment.
“while welcoming the signing of the permanent cessation of hostilities agreement between the ethiopian federal government and the tplf in november 2022, the committee expressed its deep concern about the alleged extensive violations of international human rights, humanitarian and refugee laws, including in tigray, amhara and afar regions against civilians, in particular ethnic tigrayans, human rights defenders, dissenting journalists and protesters. the committee was disturbed by reports of summary executions, deliberate attacks on civilian populations, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, arbitrary and prolonged detention without charges and judicial process, incommunicado detention in unofficial facilities or military centres, recruitment and use of children in the hostilities, conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking in persons, denial of access to humanitarian assistance and the destruction of civilian property by all parties to the conflict. it urged ethiopia to investigate all alleged violations, especially those that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, committed in the conflict in tigray and surrounding areas. the committee further asked ethiopia to ensure full and unconditional humanitarian access to all conflict-affected areas,” the report reads.cat further states “the committee was gravely concerned about complaints of torture and ill-treatment by police officers, prison guards and other military and security forces members in police stations, detention centres, federal prisons, military bases and in unofficial or secret detention places. it also noted with concern that there is still no independent, effective and confidential mechanism to handle complaints of torture or ill-treatment in detention facilities and that existing investigation bodies lack the necessary independence. the committee requested that the state party take measures to ensure all complaints of torture and ill-treatment are investigated by an independent body and that the suspected perpetrators and the superior officers responsible for ordering or tolerating these acts are duly tried and punished.”the committee also recommended ethiopia should continue to develop and implement mandatory initial and in-service training programmes to ensure that all public officials, in particular law enforcement officers, military personnel, judicial officials, prison staff, immigration personnel and others who may be involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment of persons subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment, are well acquainted with the provisions of the convention, especially the absolute prohibition of torture, and that they are fully aware that breaches will not be tolerated and will be investigated and that those responsible will be prosecuted and, on conviction, appropriately punished"
"human rights commission calls on government to stop arbitrary arrests of journalists and to respect citizens’ rights in addition to lifting the internet restriction imposed on social media as it is violation of the human rights principle.
the call on the fight for free press came at a time when the ethiopian media council in collaboration with its partners celebrated the world press freedom day on may 3, 2023 in an event held at inter luxury hotel with the presence of journalists.
speaking at the celebration, head of the commission daniel bekele /phd/ called the government to respect the national media law, stating, “the new media law has provided exceptional circumstances in which detaining journalists before they are found guilty as not allowable,” adding that, “despite enacting the new media law which forbids depriving journalists of their liberty at the pre-trial and trial stages, there is an increase in such practices.”
according to the latest press freedom index by the reporters without borders, the press freedom situation in ethiopia has further deteriorated as the country ranked 130 out of 180 countries with a global press freedom score of 47.7 in 2023. in 2022 ethiopia was ranked 114 out of 180 with a global press freedom score of 50.53.
amnesty international has said that “media freedom has come under significant attack” in ethiopia in 2022, with authorities arresting at least 29 journalists and media workers across the country.
“attacks, harassment, intimidation and criminalization of journalists have been escalating in east and southern africa for exposing allegations of corruption and human rights violations,” stated amnesty international’s director for east and southern africa, tigere chagutah in recent press briefings.
in a statement released on wednesday, may third together with the media institute of southern africa to mark the world press freedom day, the rights group said that the tigrayan authorities also charged five journalists with “collaboration with the enemy” the same year.
authorities across east and southern africa escalated their attacks against journalists and press freedom across the region to suppress reporting of corruption and human rights violations throughout 2022 the statement added.
the statement further said authorities in the region must stop targeting journalists and media organizations for doing their job, and create conducive environment which allows the press to work without repercussions, intimidation and imprisonment.
daniel also stated that long term internet restriction imposed on certain social media is violation of human rights, “most of the population uses facebook, telegram and youtube to express their opinion and to get information, restriction violate freedom of opinion and expression and receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”
as the council head explained, the media houses are in talks with the government in hopes that the restriction will be lifted up soon.
on april 27, 47 human rights organizations sent a letter calling on ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed to ensure unfettered internet and digital communications access.
the letter expressed alarm at the weponization of internet shutdowns in the country, highlighting several recent disruptions, including on april 3 when authorities blocked access to mobile internet during violent protests in the amhara region and in february when the government blocked access to social media platforms. the letter argues that shutting down the internet is an affront to fundamental human rights and undermines the freedom and safety of journalists."
"ministry of trade and regional integration (motri) lifts restrictions imposed on the supply of the stimulant leaf, khat, from eastern ethiopian producers to the local market.
the ministry which undertook a detailed study to implement its restrictions on the way to tackling the illicit khat trade imposed a system to limit the locally sold product supply which came to effect on january 2023.
in the new system, the product sourced from eastern ethiopia, which is a long established hub for production of the stimulant and market for the export commodity faced limited supply which led to a lot of contraband activities to ensue.
in a bid to settle the issue, motri has now issued a letter which has been sent to the customs commission, to relinquish the applied restrictions as from april 21.
as per the system that was applied on january 27, 2023, it emplaced a quota for the supply of local market on the aim to boost the legal export market and to make farmers beneficiaries of the trade.
however, the latest announcement stated that the system has created a repercussion on farmers’ market.
“due to that the government has decided that the scheme that was applied in january must be lifted starting from april 21,” the letter that was signed by kassahun gofe, state minister of motri, reads.
it added that as per the decision the khat export trade system and a quota of daily consumption at border areas are now to be carried out as per the prior ways of doing business in contrast to the system imposed in january.
khat products from eastern ethiopia that is popularly known as hararge khat, which is mainly supplied to somalia and djibouti consumers.this product is arguably one of the major hard currency resources for the country, while in the past few years the market and revenue was disrupted due to illegal activities.
those who abuse the trade are smuggling khat to bordering countries, while the commodity was predestined to be originally sold for local consumption.
to curb the recently emerging challenges, motri has now introduced several controlling mechanisms and taken legal actions including revoking export license for some of the traders who are alleged on the involvement of illegal activity.
however the case is still said to pose a challenge and has had its toll on the hard currency generation from the sector."
"“with the djiboutian customs administration, we have an unambiguous working relationship.”
the words of tayo, an ethiopian operator, are unequivocal. if his words cannot lend themselves to any interpretation, it is because they are also unanimous among all his peers.
“thanks to the use of cutting-edge technologies, the processing time for goods has been considerably reduced,” added one of his colleagues, specifying that “the customs clearance procedure only takes fifteen minutes”.
“it is important that the truth be restored as soon as possible”, insists a senior official of the djiboutian customs administration. “if the regulations in force bring,” he says “a lot of facilities for the operators, they also imply obligations”.
thus, faced with its ethiopian interlocutors during the joint meeting held from march
21 to 23 at the sheraton hotel, the djiboutian side points a certain administrative heaviness.
the djiboutian side also offered to fix this by requesting access to the ethiopian customs system for the sole purpose of boosting fluidity in goods from ethiopia and intended for export via the djiboutian ports.
this is all the more true as customs clearance operations for import goods do not suffer from any delay.
“only goods for export are therefore concerned and the delays observed are in no way attributable to djiboutian customs services. because they find their source in documentary discrepancies, forcing djibouti freight forwarders to ask their ethiopian partners for corrective action in order to file the declaration in good and due form with the customs services in djibouti,” a djibouti official said.
before the deadline, the djiboutian customs administration’s leeway are very limited because they are not even informed of the presence of these goods since no declaration is recorded at this stage.
operators and customs come together around a very simple observation: a flaw exists. but this is otherwise much more damaging than it finds its source in any failure of the djiboutian customs system.
as much to say it right away: “this is a non-issue and our administration has nothing to do with it”, as one operator who requested anonymity summed it up so well.
while denouncing what he considers to be a “false trial that we are doing to our customs services”, the djiboutian ministry of foreign affairs reminds the legal channels that should be taken if a logistics company or an operator intends to lodge a complaint.
in its press release, the ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation also underlined the privileged nature of the cooperation relations between the republic of djibouti and its large ethiopian neighbor, both of which are engines of regional economic integration."
"sudan’s top general on friday declared the military’s commitment to a civilian-led government, an apparent bid for international support even as his forces battle a rival paramilitary group in a bloody power struggle that has derailed hopes for the country’s democratic transition.
in his first speech since the conflict engulfed sudan nearly a week ago, army chief gen. abdel fattah burhan pledged the military would prevail and secure the vast african nation’s “safe transition to civilian rule.” but for many sudanese, burhan’s claim rang hollow 18 months after he joined forces with his current rival to seize power in a coup that cast aside sudan’s pro-democracy forces.
burhan’s announcement came on the muslim eid al-fitr holiday, which marks the end of ramadan and its month of fasting. both sides later issued statements saying they had agreed on a three-day truce to allow people to celebrate, but residents could still hear gunfire in parts of the capital, khartoum, an hour after the truce was to take effect. two cease-fire attempts earlier this week rapidly collapsed.
u.s. secretary of state antony blinken, who has spoken to both generals, welcomed the latest truce while acknowledging that “fighting is continuing and there is serious mistrust between the two forces.”
“i reiterate my call on both sides to pause the fighting to allow civilians to take care of themselves and their families, to permit full and unimpeded humanitarian access, and to enable all civilians, including diplomatic personnel, to reach safety,” he said in a statement.
the united states, its allies and other countries have been searching in vain for ways to evacuate their citizens, which has thus far been too risky, with the two sides battling across khartoum and elsewhere. some of the heaviest fighting has been over airports.
the pentagon has moved a small number troops to a base in the nearby horn of africa country of djibouti to support an evacuation. the u.s. joint chiefs of staff chairman, gen. mark milley, discussed the situation with defense officials from germany, italy and canada at a gathering in germany on friday, a u.s. official said. one topic was ensuring that any potential evacuation efforts did not conflict. the official spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the deliberations.
the eid al-fitr holiday — typically filled with prayer, celebration and feasting — was a somber one in sudan, as gunshots rang out across the capital of khartoum and heavy smoke billowed over the skyline.
rather than out in the open, mosques held mass morning prayers inside to protect worshippers from the intensified fighting. the violence so far has killed 413 people and wounded 3,551, according to the latest toll from the world health organization. that includes at least nine children killed and 50 wounded in the fighting, said the u.n. children’s fund.
“there is no safe place anymore in khartoum,” said dallia abdelmoniem, a 37-year-old baker who fled the sudanese capital with her family on thursday, after a rocket sliced through her roof. the road to the city’s outskirts was littered with dead bodies. abdelmoniem covered the eyes of her nieces and nephews.
“our number one priority is just to stay alive,” she said from her new shelter outside the city, where she could still hear the howl of artillery and gunfire friday.
“instead of waking up to the call to prayer, people in khartoum again woke up to heavy fighting,” norway’s ambassador to sudan, endre stiansen wrote in an eid al-fitr message on twitter. “can any hell be more horrible than this?”
the sudanese military a day earlier ruled out negotiations with the rsf, saying it would only accept its surrender, and on friday it claimed to be clearing rsf positions from around khartoum. the military has appeared to have the upper hand in the fighting, with its monopoly on air power, but it was impossible to confirm its claims of advances.
the two generals vying for control over the vast african nation — burhan and his rival, rsf chief mohammed hamdan dagalo — have sought to portray themselves as supporters of democracy. in 2019, they turned against long-time autocrat omar al-bashir and pushed him out of power amid a popular uprising against his rule.
but since then, they have failed to implement agreements under which they would hand over power. their forces crushed pro-democracy protests, and in 2021 they jointly carried out a coup that removed a transitional government and entrenched them as sudan’s most powerful leaders. both forces have a long history of human rights abuses. the rsf was born out of the janjaweed militias, which were accused of atrocities in crushing a rebellion in sudan’s western darfur region in the early 2000s.
the current explosion of violence between them came after burhan and dagalo fell out over a recent internationally brokered deal with democracy activists that was meant to incorporate the rsf into the military and eventually lead to civilian rule.
the fighting continued to frustrate efforts by nations to evacuate their nationals from sudan.
german foreign minister annalena baerbock said her country was preparing for an evacuation “when we have a cease-fire that holds for at least some time.” spain has air force planes ready, but it’s ”not possible to predict” when an evacuation can occur, its foreign minister jose manuel albares said.
“the situation is simply put terrible,” swedish prime minister ulf kristersson said. “an evacuation task is risky and complicated.”
the u.s. state department on thursday confirmed the death of a u.s. private citizen in sudan, but gave no details. the u.n.’s international office of migration said one its staffers was killed when his family’s vehicle got caught in a crossfire in north kordofan province, which has seen heavy clashes between the two sides.
the violence has already pushed sudan’s population to the brink and opened a dark and tumultuous chapter in the country’s history. fears are mounting that the chaos in the strategically located nation could draw in its neighbors, including chad, egypt and libya.
the bombardment and sniper fire has hit civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, over the past week. who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus decried what he called the “reprehensible” attacks on health facilities on friday, saying they “not only jeopardize the lives of healthcare workers but also deprive vulnerable populations of essential medical care.”
who spokeswoman margaret harris told reporters in geneva that the violence has forced 20 health facilities nationwide to halt operations. a dozen other hospitals are at risk of shutting down, threatening some 50,000 severely malnourished children in sudan who are administered regular feeding by tubes to survive, according to unicef.
the sudanese red crescent said armed men looted its warehouses in khartoum on friday, stealing eight 4x4 vehicles and a truck. it expressed concern that the vehicles, which bear red crescent markings, could be used in “criminal or commercial” activities.
“it’s really hard to remain calm,” said abdelmoniem, describing shortages of fuel, medicine, cash and food causing desperation in much of khartoum.
“people are telling me, ’happy eid,” she added. “but then i turn on the news.”"
"about 2.3 million children remain out of school in northern ethiopia despite last november’s peace agreement ending two years of conflict with reconstruction of damaged buildings yet to commence, said save the children, calling for urgent funding to help re-open classrooms.
across the country more than 3.5 million children are out of school – or 1 in every 16 children – in what has been called one of the world’s worst education crises.
recent data revealed massive damage to schools across conflict-affected areas of tigray, amhara and afar in northern ethiopia, according to the latest report from the ethiopia education cluster that comprises the ministry of education, save the children and unicef. the situation is particularly bad in tigray, where 85% of schools have serious or partial damage, and all public schools remain closed.
as a result of the covid pandemic followed by two years of conflict, 2.3 million children in the region have been out of school for around three years. 22,500 teachers have gone without pay for more than two years, according to the ethiopia education cluster.
children who are out of school for prolonged periods are at risk of exploitation, sexual violence, early marriage and child labour and lose their right to an education.
zinash, 13, is a fifth-grade student at a primary school in ethiopia’s amhara region. her family makes a living through small-scale farming and livestock. as a result of the conflict, her family was forced to flee their home and zinash dropped out of school for one year. zinash is now one of the few children who has been able to return to school. she said:
“a year ago, my family and i ran from our village escaping the fighting that broke out here. houses were destroyed by the conflict and properties were damaged and many people had to flee the area. now after almost a year, i am able to continue my education and i am in grade five at a nearby primary school.”
save the children is running safe spaces where children can receive emotional support and are encouraged to express their feelings through games and role play. the aid agency is also providing books and other learning materials to help children such as zinash go back to school, but more needs to be done to meet people’s humanitarian needs, including children’s education.
a un appeal for ethiopia is only 18.4% funded, which means an additional $3.26 billion usd is desperately needed.
save the children’s country director for ethiopia, xavier joubert, said “the current humanitarian crisis in ethiopia is one of the worst in recent memory. conflict, hunger and the impact of the climate crisis have forced millions from their homes, resulting in countless children being forced to drop out of school.
“it’s essential that school buildings which have been damaged or destroyed by the conflict are fixed, and that unpaid teachers receive an incentive for their work. we are supporting children affected by the conflict to continue learning, but more needs to be done to ensure every last child affected by the humanitarian crisis, including conflict, has access to an education.”
save the children has been operating in ethiopia for over 60 years. the agency was among the first to respond to the humanitarian crisis resulting from conflict in the northern part of the country while continuing humanitarian assistance to the prolonged humanitarian crises in oromia, somali and other regions. the organisation focuses on health, nutrition, water and sanitation, protection services, education and cash and in-kind distributions.
in 2022, save the children reached about 7.6 million people including about 5.1 million children through life-saving food, water distribution, and treatment for malnutrition among other services."
"chinese telecommunications giant, huawei, reports a nearly 69% decline in net profit in 2022, hopes for a better bloom in 2023.
in a press conference given on friday march 31, 2023, the top management of the company indicated that in its operation in 2022, the tech giant generated cny 642.3 billion in revenue and cny 35.6 billion profits ($5.18 billion), down 69% from 2021, despite pressure from the pandemic, u.s. sanctions, higher commodity costs, more r&d spending, and a decline in the company’s consumer business, which mostly sells smartphones. with the sale of honor, its low cost smartphone division, huawei made a higher than average profit of 113.7 billion yuan ($16.6 billion) in 2021.
“in 2022, a challenging external environment and non-market factors continued to take a toll on huawei operations,” said eric xu, huawei rotating chairman, at the company’s annual report press conference adding, “in the midst of this storm, we kept racing ahead, doing everything in our power to maintain business continuity and serve our customers. we also went to great lengths to grow the harvest – generating a steady stream of revenue to sustain our survival and lay the groundwork for future development.”
according to xu, 2023 may be important for huawei’s survival and expansion. “plum flower sweetness tends to increase in a cold, severe winter. at now, huawei looks like a plum blossom. even if we are under a lot of pressure, we have what it takes to thrive because of our growth prospects, steady business portfolio, and completely unique competitive edge, the belief of our clients and partners, and courage to spend a lot of money on r&d. we have faith in our ability to succeed in whatever task set before us and lay the groundwork for our long-term survival and expansion.”
huawei says it will continue to grow its research and development spending, bringing its total over the previous ten years to more than cny 977.3 billion in 2022 with an annual investment of cny 161.5 billion representing 25.1% of the company’s revenues.
the company has persisted in expanding its platform capabilities through its harmony os, kunpeng, ascend, and cloud portfolios, with a focus on improving the developer experience and enabling and assisting its environment partners on all fronts. in order to support environmentally-based innovation and provide more value for its customers, huawei currently collaborates with over 40,000 environmental partners and over 9 million developers.
sabrina meng, huawei’s cfo said that the overall business performance in 2022 were in line with predictions, “while under a lot of pressure. at the end of 2022, our liabilities ratio was 58.9% and we had cny 176.3 billion in net cash. the total value of our assets also reached one trillion yuan, with the vast bulk of that sum consisting of current assets including cash, short-term investments, and operating assets. our financial situation is still solid, adaptable, and remarkably resilient.”
founded in 1987, huawei is a leading global provider of information and communications technology (ict) infrastructure and smart devices. we have 207,000 employees and we operate in more than 170 countries and regions, serving more than three billion people around the world."
"africa’s gdp will expand by 3.9 percent in 2023, up from 3.6 percent in 2022 according to projections made by the united nations economic commission for africa (uneca).
while presenting a report on recent economic and social developments in africa wednesday at the 55th session of the commission, uneca’s macroeconomics and governance division director adam elhiraika said africa’s gdp growth declined from 4.6 percent in 2021 to 3.6 percent in 2022 but is expected to rebound to 3.9 percent in 2023.
“the slowdown in the global economy, high prices fuelled by the ukrainian conflict, climate change and worsening international economic and financial conditions significantly impacted africa’s growth in 2022,” said elhiraika, adding that the 3.9 percent growth forecast for 2023 is mainly driven by growth in the continent’s east, north and west africa sub-regions.in the developing world, africa was the fastest growing region after east and south asia (4.5 percent), followed by south-eastern europe (3.2 percent), and latin america (2.1 percent).
according to the report africa’s growth in 2022 was driven by the growth in the sub regions of east, north, and west africa. east africa’s development was predicted to peak at 5.1% in 2022 and settle at that level in 2023. central africa’s growth was predicted to rise to 3.4% in 2022, driven by rising oil prices and robust domestic production. west africa’s growth is expected to rise slightly from 3.6 in 2022 to 3.8 in 2023, but nigeria’s real gdp growth is predicted to decelerate due to the continued weakness of the oil sector.
according to the report, net export and private consumption are expected to be the key drivers of the growth in to 2023. however the tightening of global monetary policies is expected to weigh on investments on the continent. regarding the structure of african economies, they continue to be driven by the services sector, followed by the industrial and agriculture sectors, with an estimated average contribution of 56.2 per cent, 29.0 per cent and 19.3 per cent, respectively.
it is indicated that african governments are facing limited fiscal space due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates. fiscal deficits have been exacerbated by up to 0.2 percentage points, reaching -5.0% in 2022. in north africa, fiscal deficits widened from -5.7% in 2021 to -6.1% in 2022, while in southern africa the fiscal deficit improved from -4.7% to -3.4%. oil exporting countries benefited from elevated energy prices, with fiscal deficits reaching -4.6% in 2022 before an expected decrease to -4.3% in 2023.
africa’s debt-to-gdp ratio is projected to remain high due to increased public spending and declining revenues due to exogenous shocks.
fiscal deficits and debt levels are projected to improve in 2023, but they remain relatively higher or at par with pre-pandemic levels in most countries except in central and southern africa which has had significant improvements.
fiscal space remains constrained despite narrowing economic deficits, making it harder for most countries to invest in major sectors to ensure resilience from shocks, said the director, adding that rising borrowing costs and debt service burdens pose a significant challenge going forward and that africa’s debt-to-gdp ratio is estimated to reach 61.9 percent in 2023.elhiraika added that currency depreciation has been more pronounced in countries with flexible exchange rate regimes and in commodity-exporting countries.
countries with fixed exchange rates, especially those within the economic and monetary community of central africa and west african economic and monetary union experienced an average depreciation of 10 percent against the u.s. dollar in 2022.
“rising costs of funding in united states dollars pose a big risk not only to existing debt burdens but also to prospects for mobilizing resources to finance sustainable development projects. african countries should develop their domestic financial markets with sound and effective regulatory frameworks in order to lay a good foundation for the resilience of the overall financial system and to make monetary policies more effective,” stated the report.
global economic activities slowed in 2022. the main decline is driven by the conflict between russia and ukraine, and covid-19. the conflict erupted just as the africa economies were recovering from the adverse effect of the pandemic. owing to a slowdown in the global economy, a rise in prices fuelled by the ukrainian conflict, climate change and worsening international economic and financial conditions, growth in africa has been negatively affected."
"oromia region removes price caps that oblige farmers to sell a quintal of wheat for 3, 200 birr only for unions. smuggling of agricultural products, notably wheat and teff to neighboring countries has created shortage in the market, state officials from the ministry of trade with the same sentiments being echoed by regional trade bureaus.
the government recently issued a new directive that obliged farmers to hand over to unions a quintal of wheat at 3, 200 birr with the aim to accelerate the export and local supply with the unions selling to factories at 3,381 birr to flow supply. however, the directive has not had a smooth sailing.
farmers who decline to obey the directive seem to hide yields and have been forced to engage in smuggling.
according to tesfaye gesho, deputy head of oromia trade bureau, after assessing the situation, the region has now removed the price and local check points so that anyone who is legal can move and accelerate the trade in tandem with unions for the supply to the market.
scarcity of basic grain including that of wheat and teff in the market has in recent weeks pushed food costs beyond the reach of many.
on a press conference held on thursday march 16, 2023, after discussing with regional trade bureaus on the matter, the trade ministry indicated that the situation was linked partly, to economic sabotage; “illegal traders and brokers are worsening the situation,” stated the ministry.
blockage of checkpoints leading to the capital addis ababa and the existence of merchants who are attempting to manipulate prices artificially by withholding cereals (including teff) instead of making them available to buyers were also cited as a contributing factor to the shortage.
“free movement is also a challenge that traders are facing,” stated ibrahim mohamed, head of amhara regional trade bureau, showing additional challenges in conjunction to trade sabotage despite there being enough production.
also as indicated, there are illegal traders and exporters who smuggle the cultivated wheat every year across borders. a huge amount of agricultural commodities have been smuggled through moyale to kenya and others which is now becoming difficult to control with the need of attention required.
both the regional trade bureaus and the ministry indicated that there is enough production, underlining, “things will get better soon” and as indicated on the press briefing, both the federal and regional governments are working to create a direct market linkage between farmers and consumers with regional states set to provide finance to cooperatives as a revolving fund.
a month ago, a quintal of teff was anywhere between 5500-6000 birr. now it is selling for 9500 birr at a price difference of 2500 to 3500 birr. as many traders indicate, instability, increased price of fertilizer and transportation has played a huge role in the price hike.
in similar headlines, the central statistics service announced that the price increase recorded on crops has continued for consecutive months with most of the grains increase peaking in february.
on its monthly inflation report, the service indicated that in the stated months, although the country’s overall inflation had decreased slightly compared to the same month of last year, most of the cereals such as teff, wheat, barley and sorghum, meat, milk, cheese and eggs showed a slight increase.
the february 2023 general inflation currently stands at 32.0 percent while the country level food inflation soared to 36.2 percent with non-food inflation rates standing at 31.5 percent."
"united nations economic commission for africa (eca) calls member states and partners to work more on overcoming challenges faced by africa’s landlocked developing countries (lldcs) and small island developing states (sids) for the implementation of africa continental free trade area (afcfta).
this was highlighted at a high-level event jointly organized by the un economic commission for africa (eca) with the theme of “leveraging the afcfta towards addressing the peculiar trade and development challenges of africa’s lldcs and sids,” in harare, zimbabwe from february 27 and 28. as africa has 16 landlocked countries and 6 sids, senior governmental officials of these countries took part in the meeting.
“the afcfta secretariat launched a guided trade initiative in october 2022 to guide member states to trade within the agreement. to date only 8 out 46 member states who ratified the agreements are taking part in the initiative which demonstrates the willingness yet showcasing at the same time that implementation challenges exist. out of 8 countries, 1 is lldcs and 1 sids, 3 transit countries,” said jane karonga, economic affairs officer, adding that, “africa’s landlocked developing countries and sids tend to be disadvantaged in terms of industrialization because of the higher costs of freight and unpredictable transit times, environmental challenges as well as structural impediments.”
lldcs are distinguished by their absence of sea access and ensuing geographic isolation from global markets. according to the meeting, lldcs face difficulties related to delays at border crossings, transit and customer procedures, an inefficient logistics system, weak institutions, and poor infrastructure, all of which contribute to significantly higher transportation and other trade transaction costs for these countries compared to their coastal counterparts. as mentioned, these probative costs undermine lldcs’ attempts to completely benefit from regional and global flow, decrease competitiveness, diminish export profits, increase the cost of imported manufacturing inputs, and discourage investment.
“afcfta is accompanied by many annexes and instruments such as rules of origin, dispute mechanism settlement, ntb monitoring system, and the agreement itself given them additional years to liberalize their goods in addition to a protocol on free movement of people thereby ensuring that the agreement is inclusive and sustainable,” jane explained.
sids also experience a variety of difficulties, such as their remote geographic location, which frequently results in expensive import and export fees for goods and services as well as erratic levels of international traffic. according to estimates, compared to other emerging nations, sids are at least 35% more susceptible to financial and economic shocks.
“issues of debt, impact of ukraine and russian war, building back living with covid and inflationary tendencies is constraining the lldcs and sids much more given their landlockedness and sealockedness. however, afcfta presents an opportunity to address some of these challenges due to its promise in integrating the continent into a single market and can address their peculiar challenges in a targeted manner.”
the meeting offers some actionable recommendations on how to leverage the opportunities afforded by the afcfta for accelerated implementation of the priorities of the vpoa and the samoa pathway.
“i believe political will is present in these countries as demonstrated by ratification of afcfta. the missing ingredient is technical and financial resources coupled by peace and security issues is some of countries is making development a challenge,” jane emphasizes.
“the main outcome from the meeting is that the challenges faced by lldcs and sids are still prevalent and more needs to be done by respective member states and partners to address the unique challenges faces by these countries. implementation of the afcfta is seen as a game changer in turning the challenge into opportunities in these countries,” said jane adding that further, financial and technical resources are needed as well as good governance and leadership which is critical to drive implementation.
“the successful implementation of the afcfta is an imperative for the african lldcs and sids as it can facilitate their integration into regional and global value chains as well as expand their trade and productive capabilities. the afcfta provides particular benefits: in addition to reduction in tariffs as well as provisions on trade facilitation, transit and customs cooperation and collaborative efforts to address adverse climate changes,” said jane indicating that eca will support in advocacy, training, research, capacity building and convening meeting for members to sharing of experiences and learn from each other.
“lldcs and sids can often be differentiated by the specific challenges they face, but are also confronted with many common challenges, particularly those related to the economic, social, and environmental factors that are global in scale,” said melaku desta coordinator of eca’s african trade policy centre (atpc).
“capacity dimension is key in advancing lldcs and sids to leverage afcfta to realize agenda 2060,” complimented mamadou biteye, acbf executive secretary adding that, “acbf is prioritizing trade and major economic growth as one of its strategy focusing areas and collaboration with its other partners is looking for a way to support countries accelerate implementation of afcfta.”
manasseh ntaganda, a senior policy officer in the african union commission’s department of economic development, trade, tourism, industry and mining, drew attention to the serious difficulties that lldcs still face as a result of the covid-19’s lingering effects, which have now been made even worse by the latest disruptions brought on by the conflict in ukraine. she emphasized that the solutions outlined in the vpoa and samoa completely address these unusual difficulties. she stressed the value of trade facilitation, connectivity, and the use of cutting-edge technologies to help lldcs and sids integrate into major markets, “in advance of the fourth international conference on sids, which will be held in 2024, and the third united nations conference on lldcs, this meeting provides a chance to discuss development priorities for these two groups of countries.”"
"ethiopian millers association express concerns over shortage of wheat supply to their factories.
according to the association, which has more than 220 member factories, it usually buys wheat from different parts of the country based on the season and the type of wheat including from bale, awash, arisi, and gojam.
according to muluneh lema, president of the association, based on the season, factories had been expecting wheat supply from bale, oromia region’s largest wheat producer, however, the wheat market has been rattled by interruptions for the past five or six weeks especially in the capital addis ababa.
“beside wheat price increasing by more than one thousand birr per quintal it has been more than five weeks since the factories that produce flour and related products stopped getting wheat from the market,” said muluneh, adding that, “a number of factories are cutting their production of flour.”as the association indicated previously one quintal of wheat used to be sold for 4,700 birr which now has jumped to 5,700 birr.
“we have also confirmed through field observations that ethiopia has increased its wheat production,” said the president explaining that he is confident that there will be no shortage of wheat production this season.
however, due to the interruption of the wheat market, the president alluded that factories are also buying smuggled wheat at high prices.
a week ago, prime minister abiy ahmed attended the national wheat export launch program in bale zone, oromia region as part of the government’s plan to halt import of wheat and embark on the export of its own wheat production.
according to the ministry of agriculture from this year’s autumn harvest season, 112 million quintals and 52 million quintal of wheat production from irrigation and summer season is expected to be reaped.
therefore, the forecasted production rate indicates that there will be excess production in terms of domestic demand which is estimated at 97 million quintals with an additional 32 million quintals of wheat being projected for export.
muluneh stated that although they are very supportive of ethiopia starting to export wheat, they do not think that the export trade will create a problem for the domestic wheat market as this year a high level of production has been produced at the national level.
“even those who were getting the supply in different ways or using from their stock may not continue for long if the situation is not solved quickly and it may affect the supply of bread and other products,” the president indicated.ever since the problem occurred, the association has been informing the ministry of trade and regional relations and the ministry of finance by letter, and they believe that the efforts they are making by going to the front will yield results.
it is said that one of the reasons of the unintended wheat trading problem is related to the inability to properly implement the oromia region’s wheat trading guidelines.
according to muluneh, in a meeting held in adama with the relevant government, it was decided upon for unions to supply wheat to factories from farmers at rates of one quintal of wheat with 3,200 birr and to sell it to factories for 3,381 birr.
“when we follow up on which unions we are working with, the unions did not get enough financing, and after that it almost fell flat with unclear information,” said muluneh.
muluneh, emphasized that production in itself was not the thorn in the scenario but the way how the market process is run."
"the fall in international coffee price raises rate of contract terminations of coffee export as the ethiopian coffee and tea authority (ecta) signals concern citing that the authority in talks with buyers to finish exporting stored export standard coffee within 3 months.
“as a result of decrease in the international coffee price, export volume has also decreased,” said adugna debela /phd/, head of the authority, indicating that the past six months have shown slight decrease in volume while revenue showed increments of 80 million dollars from last year but still only meeting 67 percent of the target.
in the first half of the fiscal year, the country exported 117,000 tons of coffee worth usd 663 million as the authority target to generate usd two billion over the course of the current fiscal year by exporting 360,000 tons of the beans.
“due to international price decrease exporters are hoarding their coffee as the price they get locally is expensive than the international price they anticipate to sell to, rendering them to hold on to the coffee for speculated increase. we are working to improve the situation by engaging with different stakeholders including buyers,” said the ecta head.
as data shows, a pound of coffee cost usd 2.5 during a year back. however, the number now has dropped to usd 1.5, a decrease of $1 per pound and almost $2 per kilogram of coffee.
in the first half of the fiscal year, 288 contracts with 181 exporters were terminated, according to the authority.
“exporter have large amount of stocked export standard coffee due to termination of contracts. we are in discussion with buyers to solve the matter and to increase the volume and with exporters to review their contract,” said adugna, adding, “we believe in the two or three months exporters will finish exporting coffee they have in their backlog stock due to termination of contacts. this is one measure to achieve our target.”
the cost of the item has decreased by 50% on the international market since last year. less purchasing power has caused a decline in interest from buying nations. ethiopia’s attempts to make money off the commodity are hampered by both of these circumstances. brazil is also making a return after suffering a frost disaster that destroyed its coffee plantations.
“there is no shortage of supply and volume, however, due to the situation there is a slowdown in the interest of buying countries which we have to wait until situations improve,” adugna emphasized.
“ethiopian coffee is one of the best qualities in the world and we are always improving. we believe that having high quality would get us to increase the revenue even though volume shows decrease from last year,” he further explained.
throughout the course of the preceding year 2021/22, for the first time ever, coffee exporters came together to supply the global market with goods valued usd 1.4 billion from the exports of 300,000 metric tons of coffee.
also ethiopia was able to earn usd 1.75 billion from exports during the first half of the 2022–2023 fiscal year, according to the ministry of trade and regional integration.
exports of manufactured goods, dairy and meat products, electric power, and mining products each contributed 10%, 2.9%, 2.9%, and 6.62% of the total revenue, respectively, while exports of agricultural commodities generated 77.23% of the overall income.
according to the ministry, the nation met 76% of its export goal during the previous six months. it cited poor global demand and smuggling of agricultural goods into neighboring nations as reasons why the goal export volume was not reached."
"with 11 occurrences apiece, ethiopia is now one of the two most heavily affected nations in africa by internet outages.
facebook, telegram, and tiktok have been blocked in ethiopia as from february 9, 2023 as a result of protests over the breakup of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church (eotc). this is ethiopia’s eleventh forced internet outage since 2015, according to surfshark’s internet shutdown tracker.
in times of upheaval, undemocratic regimes frequently suspend internet access in an effort to head off criticism of their conduct and, ultimately, to quiet the populace. many ethiopians won’t be able to connect with one another or plan protests if access to these three major social media platforms is restricted, according to gabriele racaityte-krasauske, a spokeswoman for surfshark.
since 2015, ethiopia has shut down internet access a total of 11 times. six of these cases involved other forms of political unrest, while five of them involved protests.
wider anti-government sentiment has been created by protests related to the eotc split. even though the government typically doesn’t make the restriction public, ethiopia has a history of limiting social media during protests.
in 2022, internet outages afflicted 1 in 4 africans. internet outages impacted more than 300 million africans in 2022, according to surfshark’s annual report on internet censorship.
after asia, africa has the second-highest level of internet censorship; in addition to long-term limitations, five african nations filtered the internet 13 times in 2022.
globally, mass internet filtering had an impact on 4.2 billion people in 2022, according to surfshark’s internet censorship yearly report. in 2022, asia accounted for almost half of all new cases, with africa coming in second. autocratic countries continue to utilize internet censorship as a popular tactic to cut off its citizens from the outside world.
facebook is the social media site most despised by despotic countries and was still heavily censored in 2022. in reality, since 2015, a startling 46% of the world’s population has been impacted by by facebook bans in some form.
in 2017, burkina faso’s ban on facebook was the longest in the world, lasting longer than those in russia and azerbaijan. the prohibition was in place until 2023. following its invasion of ukraine, russia has continued to cause disruptions on twitter, facebook, and instagram. access to important international news websites has also been banned by the nation.
tiktok was censored in azerbaijan in september. even now, access to the platform is still limited.
by the number of internet disruptions, asia continues to be ahead of africa. in 2022, 58 occurrences of new internet outages were imposed by 11 asian nations. the world’s greatest disruption total (24), followed by iran (11) and india, in the jammu & kashmir area (10).
with five nations adopting 13 limitations in 2022, africa became the second most disruptive area behind asia. by the number of disruptions, sudan leads all of africa with four, followed by burkina faso (3), zimbabwe (3), sierra leone (2), and somalia (1)."
"demonstration called offethiopia’s government and the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church (eotc) have been at odds for the past three weeks, with the church alleging that the government is aiding a group that staged an anti-coup attempt on the sacred synod.
the conflict started on january 22 when three orthodox bishops announced the formation of the ostensibly 25-episcopate-strong “holy synod of oromia nations and nationalities.” three days later, the eotc’s holy synod, which represents the majority of the nation’s more than 50 million adherents, formally excommunicated each of them.
the now-excommunicated “illegitimate group” was criticized by the eotc, led by his holiness patriarch abune mathias, over remarks made by prime minister abiy ahmed.
speaking to cabinet members earlier in the week, abiy urged the adversaries on each side has their “own realities” to which his holiness in response said, “the government should not meddle in the ecclesiastical and canonical matters of the church.”
the patriarchate has refuted the charges made by the dissident bishops that the church discriminates against oromian congregations and practices linguistic and cultural hegemony there.
following the recent conflict, security authorities recently killed about 30 ethiopian orthodox believers in shashemene, oromia region, for defending their church from “the politically-motivated” isolated group. over the past few weeks, the conflict between the government and the ethiopian orthodox church has intensified which has led government to place red beret soldiers and heavily armed federal police on the streets of major cities, including the capital, addis ababa.
on february 1, the synod of the eotc sent a warning to the government, threatening that if corrective action was not taken to, that is, “to uphold the institutional supremacy of the church, the rights and interests given to it by law, and by giving appropriate correction to the illegal actions of the breakaway archbishops,” a worldwide peaceful demonstration would be called for on february 12.
in response to the church’s call for a demonstration, the government has released comments claiming that certain individuals and groups are attempting to overturn the government violently by using the internal affairs of the eotc.
the eotc, on the other hand, asserts that the government is supporting a group that attempted to overthrow the church.
one of the claims made by the church is that the head of the eotc was kidnapped at jimma airport and that people were killed for attempting to defend their churches from the isolated group. instead of defending the centuries-old ethiopian orthodox church, the government has been allowing the isolated group to invade and rob its churches.
the eotc announced that it will proceed with its scheduled demonstrations in ethiopia peacefully and requested the government to protect the population while obeying the law, indicating that peaceful demonstrations are guaranteed under the ethiopian constitution.
the rebel archbishops have also urged their supporters to attend marches on the same day in addis ababa and other cities around the nation.
the joint security and intelligence task force issued a statement in which it expressed concern that “agitations are being made to use the opportunity to take the lives of citizens and to engage in other conflict-provoking activities,” adding that, “this approach is opening the door for anti-peace forces working to destroy our country by using the incident as a cover.”
the ethiopian national defense forces, the federal police commission, and the information network security agency, which make up the joint security and intelligence task force, further blamed the social media activists for escalating the situation and fomenting violence.
given that there is no permitted form of demonstration from the relevant body, the joint task force also issued a warning to the entire populace to refrain from “illegal demonstration and conflict-inciting activities.”
any harm done to the populace and the nation is the responsibility of “any force that acts illegally and those who try to coordinate and participate in the demonstrations.” in an effort to maintain the nation’s peace and security, the joint task force will take the required legal action, according to the statement.
however, the church said on thursday, february 9 that it would summon the planned peaceful demonstration whether the government allowed it or not, using its legal and international rights, if it didn’t receive all the answers to its inquiries and discovered it had arrested church members within 48 hours. schools in the nation’s capital were closed on friday due to the tense mood in the city, and internet connectivity has been poor in many parts of the country in recent hours amid protests over the crisis.
additionally, the church said on friday, february 10, 2023, that it had a conversation with the prime minister about the issue; to which pm abiy expressed believes that all of the church’s queries are legitimate and accurate, citing that the issue will be solved in due course. after the discussion the church called off the demonstration on saturday february 11. the government has also pledged to address demands from the church.
in its latest report released on friday february 10, 2023, the ethiopian human rights commission, a panel of independent specialists, cited that at least 13 people died at the hands of “ethiopian security forces aid workers” who used “disproportionate force” to disperse an attempt to occupy the church of st. michael the archangel.
the commission, in its report published this friday, denounces a campaign of repression against followers of the tewahedo orthodox church who have opposed the creation of this new synod, and who have been victims of “beatings, intimidation, expulsion from churches and extrajudicial arrests”.
additionally, the eotc has asked the federal high court’s lideta division’s fundamental rights and freedoms bench to impose a three-month injunction against the three breakaway archbishops and the 25 appointed episcopate until the church is ready to file a formal lawsuit against them. on friday, the ethiopian federal high court issued an order of injunction in favor of the church that forbids schismatics from entering any eotc parish or church. the court has mandated that the oromia police commission, oromia regional state, and the ministry of peace federal police to carry out the decision.
different sister churches of ethiopia and worldwide including the roma catholic church, coptic church of egypt and others have shown their solidarity in supporting the church and opposing the split group."
"by our staff reporter
human-rights abuses by military and police forces are one of the key factors that push africans into violent extremist groups, a united nations study has concluded after more than 1,000 interviews with former jihadist fighters.
the study by the un development program found that africa is becoming the “new global epicentre” for violent extremism. while deaths from terrorism have declined globally in the past five years, they have more than doubled in that same period in africa, where almost half of the world’s terrorism-related deaths are now occurring, the report said.
a separate report this week by the africa center for strategic studies confirmed the trend. it found that the number of deaths linked to militant islamist groups in africa had surged by 48 per cent last year, while the number of violent events by such groups had increased by 22 per cent, reaching a new record.
yet governments are too often responding to extremist groups with militarized action, which can be self-defeating, the undp report said. state security crackdowns, accompanied by a sharp escalation in human-rights abuses, are often the biggest reason why people join violent extremist groups in africa, it found.
instead, the study recommended governments should invest in education, social welfare and economic development programs that can prevent the drift into jihadism.
“security-driven counterterrorism responses are often costly and minimally effective, yet investments in preventive approaches to violent extremism are woefully inadequate,” undp administrator achim steiner said in a statement accompanying the report.
the study is based on interviews with nearly 2,200 people, including more than 1,000 former members of violent extremist groups, in eight african countries: mali, burkina faso, nigeria, somalia, sudan, chad, cameroon and niger.
in total, more than 51,000 africans have died as a result of extremist violence in the past decade, and the economic cost of terrorism on the continent has been close to us$100-billion annually, the study found.
another factor was a lack of education. nearly 60 per cent of the recruits had low levels of education, the study found. each additional year of schooling tended to reduce the likelihood of voluntary recruitment to jihadist groups by 13 per cent, it found.
in addition to these broad factors, nearly half of those interviewed said there was a specific trigger event that pushed them into the decision to join an extremist group. of those, 71 per cent said the “tipping point” was a human-rights abuse, often by a state security force.
it quoted a 35-year-old nigerian woman named fatima, for example, who said a military jet had attacked her village and killed many people. “i decided to join and followed husband in order to avenge the killing,” she told the researchers.
such trigger events, linked to anger and fear, were “a significant accelerator of recruitment” for many people, the study said. those who did not experience a specific trigger or “tipping point” were much less likely to join a jihadist group.
“it illustrates the importance of addressing grievances, revealed as state action and human-rights abuses in this data sample, as a critical bulwark to counter and address vulnerabilities that may lead to violent extremism,” the study said."
"un world economic situation and prospects (wesp) 2023 report, projects ethiopia’s inflation rate to fair on at 24.9 percent in 2023, signaling a decrease from 34.5 percent in 2022 which at the time was catalyzed by war and crises.
the report indicates that central banks including ethiopia, ghana, sierra leone, sudan and zimbabwe face the most pressing needs for monetary policy tightening.
“the sociopolitical and security conditions in several countries remain challenging for the continent, particularly in burkina faso, cameroon, central african republic, chad, ethiopia, mali and mozambique,” stated the release.
to combat inflation and exchange rate pressure, about two thirds of african countries increased domestic policy interest rates in 2022. the report reveals that most countries will likely further increase rates in 2023 in parallel with the projected monetary stance of the federal reserve in the united states and the european central bank.
in line with the global pickup in inflation, price levels have risen significantly in african countries but are projected to moderate in 2023. the share of african countries experiencing double-digit inflation rocketed to 40 per cent in 2022, driven mainly by supply chain disruptions and the fallout from the war in ukraine, which made essential food and energy items more expensive.
the war in ukraine has further weakened the growth prospects of african economies since it came at a time when countries were reeling from the adverse impacts of the covid 19 pandemic, climate shocks and heightened security risks in some countries. global commodity price shocks have reverberated through african economies, especially through rising energy, fertilizer and food prices. these have translated into increasing import bills for most net food and oil importers and shrinking gdp. the crisis has further highlighted vulnerabilities due to supply constraints, weak infrastructure, economic dependence on external partners and volatile global markets, all of which leave the poor more at risk of extreme poverty and food insecurity.
the persistence of the war is projected to push an additional 1.8 million people into extreme poverty in 2022 and 2.1 million in 2023 (afdb, 2022). the economic commission for africa estimates that the crisis could cut gdp growth by up to 0.7 percentage points in 2022 and drive poverty up by 0.5 percentage points. many african countries have a high share of food weight in the consumer price index, averaging 41.9 (higher than in many advanced economies), which weighs heavily as indicated on the report.
food items occupy the largest share in many household consumption baskets across africa, with an expenditure share of about 42 per cent, compared to 13 per cent and 6 per cent for france and the united states, respectively. the expenditure share is much higher in fragile states, where food consumption can reach well over 60 per cent of total expenditure. further, social protection coverage is limited in africa as a whole. only 17 per cent of people receive at least one social protection benefit compared with the global average of 47 per cent. this leaves 1.2 billion africans without any social protection coverage (ilo, 2021), a situation expected to further exacerbate food insecurity.
aggregate output in africa is projected to remain subdued amid a volatile and uncertain global environment compounding domestic challenges. the continent has been hit by a confluence of shocks, comprising weaker demand from key trading partners, a sharp uptick in global inflation, higher borrowing costs and adverse weather events.
“these are undermining its full recovery from the pandemic. real output losses compared to pre-pandemic projections continue to be large, with africa remaining a full 2.4 percentage points below its pre-pandemic projected real output. this contrasts with developed economies, which have more than recuperated from their 2020 losses in terms of real output,” the report explains.
aggregate economic growth is estimated to weaken to 3.8 per cent in 2023 from 4.1 per cent in 2022, due to subdued investment and deteriorating export volumes. in 2023, growth is expected to pick up in east africa and west africa while stabilizing in central africa.
as the report indicate commodity exporters in africa will likely face weaker market conditions given the expected global economic slowdown. export prices will probably remain high, however, amid fierce competition for the continent’s primary commodities.
as indicated several countries are still coping with the repercussions of the covid 19 pandemic. with under a quarter (24.1 per cent) of people in africa fully vaccinated against the virus, the continent remains vulnerable to renewed outbreaks and the possible arrival of new variants. accordingly extreme poverty is projected to become increasingly concentrated in sub-saharan africa.
on the bright side, the economy is expected to grow by 4.8 percent in 2023, compared to the growth of 3.0 percent in 2022."
"children are facing a growing risk of disease as cholera and measles outbreaks tighten their grip on ethiopia, raising fears for the many vulnerable children already suffering from malnutrition, save the children said.
a cholera outbreak is affecting the oromia and somali regions, with at least 1,055 cases reported, including 28 deaths, since september 2022. in the past month alone, more than 316 cases have been reported in the two regions, a 30% jump from 739 cases at the end of december 2022, with one million people at risk of the disease in the two regions.
spikes in measles cases have also been reported with 357 new measles cases and 6 deaths reported in the last week of january alone, according to health authorities.
a deadly combination of severe water shortages, poor hygiene and sanitation services, including open defecation and lack of water treatment options are driving the rapid spread of cholera, with severe drought exacerbating the situation.
as taps run dry, many families struggle to get clean water for use at home. health authorities have pointed out that more than 80% of patients admitted for cholera were found to have consumed river water. in ethiopia, more than 13 million people including 6.8 million children are in dire need of safe water. the situation is likely to get worse as the country enters the january-march dry season. forecasts predict that rainfall in the upcoming rainy season in april will be below average.
last month save the children said back-to-back droughts caused by five failed rainy seasons have left 12 million ethiopians facing hunger as conflict and forced displacement exacerbate the hunger crisis in the country. this is also causing widespread malnutrition with 3.9 million children in ethiopia severely malnourished– accounting for around half of people suffering from malnutrition across the whole of the horn of africa.
in the somali and oromia regions of ethiopia, distraught mothers are arriving at save the children’s malnutrition stabilization centres with children showing severe symptoms and complications caused by malnutrition.
hodan* lives with her husband and four children in the somali region. her husband is currently working as a farmhand back in their village after being edged out of his pastoralist lifestyle by the ongoing severe drought.
in the last four months, hodan* told save the children, she has lost 3 goats and 3 camels leaving her family without a source of income and nutrition. this has left her struggling to feed her family including her 19-month-old daughter, ayaan* who is suffering from the deadliest form of malnutrition. ayaan* has been admitted to stabilization centre at kelafo health centre, where she will receive life-saving therapeutic feeding treatment. hodan says “i am not able to feed my children because of drought and we don’t have any money. we used to keep animals but we have lost all of them. my child has been sick for one month. when i saw the child is getting worse i decided to take her to the nearest health facility where i can get medication. that’s why i came here.”
by mid-january this year, kelafo health centre had admitted 18 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, 3 more children than it admitted the whole of january 2022 and pointing to a worsening situation in ethiopia.
save the children’s country director for ethiopia, xavier joubert, said “we know babies like ayaan are particularly susceptible to cholera and measles during droughts because malnutrition lowers the body’s defences, making children more vulnerable to the diseases and their complications. in ethiopia, more than two-thirds of cholera patients are children. we are concerned that most of those who have died from cholera are children under the age of 14, with 25% of them under five. we are calling for more funds to provide food, water and health services to affected communities.
“it’s clear that the current drought is contributing to these disease outbreaks and we are worried this is going to have severe consequences for children already battling malnutrition. we urgently need to ensure that every child has access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.”
save the children has been operating in ethiopia for over 60 years and was amongst the first respondents to the humanitarian crisis resulting from the conflict in the northern part of ethiopia, while continuing humanitarian assistance to the prolonged humanitarian crises in oromia and somali regions. the organisation’s work is heavily anchored on health and nutrition as well as life-saving water and sanitation assistance, protection services, education support, and cash and in-kind distributions to the most vulnerable children and their families.
in 2022, save the children reached 7,574,882 people including 5,140,968 children through lifesaving food, water distribution, treatment for malnutrition among other services."
"shortage of import inputs renders 10 out of 28 leather factories /tanneries to halt production as the remaining 18 work under minimal capacities, the ethiopian leather industries associations (elia) reveals.
“the sector is challenging to operate since almost 99 percent of inputs like chemical, accessories and others are imported for factories,” said solomon getu, secretary of elia, adding, “the industry is mostly dependent on foreign currency to import inputs from the existing 28 leather producing industries, 10 of which have fully stopped their production. from the remaining 18, only 8 are working at 40-50 percent production capacity while the rest ten are working with less than 15 percent of their capacity.”
it is to be recalled that a few months back the association had requested the relevant government bodies, ministry of industry and national bank of ethiopia (nbe) to re-amend the forex retention for factories to access more foreign currencies they earned from their export earnings to import inputs.
the association expressed that the leather industry aught at least to access 40 percent of the foreign currency earned for the purpose of import inputs.
the retention and utilization of export earnings and inward remittances directives no. fxd/79/2022 that was amended and became effective on january 6 on its article 4.1 stated that banks are required to surrender 70 percent of the foreign currency earnings from export of goods and services, private-transfer and ngo’s transfer to the nbe.
however, as solomon indicates, no response has been given by the relevant bodies.
with the leather tanneries and leather product manufacturing industries being related; the impact on leather tanneries is said to have a ripple effect on the producers.
in the 2021/22 budget year, the leather and leather goods export generated only 40 million dollars. as solomon manifested for the current budget year it will be difficult even to generate 30 million dollars from exporting leather products if the situation continues with the way it is now.in the past three years, the export earnings from the sector have declined in relation to internal and external factors like covid 19.
in the 2017/18 and 2018/19 budget year the sector contributed usd 130 million and usd 120 million respectively that reduced to usd 75 million in the 2019/20 budget year.
meanwhile, the export earnings have eroded compared with the preceding year. nonetheless, the local market has been boosted in the budget year as per the explanation of solomon.
as he indicates, the ministry of industry and the development bank of ethiopia are working to facilitate forex access to smes including the leather industry which they expect could be an option to solve the problem.
the association in collaboration with the ministry of industry and the ministry of trade and regional integration and united nations industrial development organization /unido/ has organized the 13th all african leather fair to be held from february 16-18, 2023 at the millennium hall.
as indicated, more than 250 local and international tanners, footwear and leather goods manufacturers, leather garment producers, machinery and input suppliers and technology logistics and financial institutions and companies and more than 17,000 visitors are expected on the occasion.
“the upcoming event will play a great role to initiate the leather industry and reverse the downturn of the leather sector after math of the pandemic and international market failure,” remarked remedan bedada, president of the association, whilst expressing hope for a positive turn for the industry."
"the wealthiest people on the globe who account for only 1 percent of the world population grabbed nearly two-thirds of all new wealth nearly 60 percent of the world’s hungry population reveals a new oxfam report.
new wealth worth 42 trillion dollars was created to the financial elite since 2020 which in perspective was almost twice as much money as the bottom 99 percent of the world’s population according to the report.
billionaires have seen extraordinary increases in their wealth. during the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis years since 2020, 26 trillion dollars (63 percent) of all new wealth was captured by the richest 1 percent, while 16 trillion dollar (37 percent) went to the rest of the world put together. during the past decade, the richest 1 percent had captured around half of all new wealth.
a billionaire gained roughly 1.7 million dollar for every 1dollar of new global wealth earned by a person in the bottom 90 percent. billionaire fortunes have increased by 2.7 billion dollar a day. this comes on top of a decade of historic gains the number and wealth of billionaires having doubled over the last ten years.
the report shows that billionaire wealth surged in 2022 with rapidly rising food and energy profits as 95 food and energy corporations had more than doubled their profits in 2022.
the said corporations made 306 billion dollars in windfall profits, and paid out 257 billion dollars (84 percent) of that to rich shareholders. at the same time, at least 1.7 billion workers now live in countries where inflation is outpacing wages, and over 820 million people roughly one in ten people on earth are going hungry. women and girls often eat least and last, and make up nearly 60 percent of the world’s hungry population.
the world bank revealed that the world is seeing the biggest increase in global inequality and poverty since world war 2. as noted, most countries are facing bankruptcy, with the poorest countries now spending four times more repaying debts to rich creditors than on healthcare. three-quarters of the world’s governments are planning austerity-driven public sector spending cuts including on healthcare and education by 7.8 trillion dollars over the next five years.
the report shows that taxes on the wealthiest used to be much higher. over the last forty years, governments across africa, asia, europe, and the americas have slashed the income tax rates on the richest. at the same time, they have upped taxes on goods and services, which fall disproportionately on the poorest people and exacerbate gender inequality.
“while ordinary people are making daily sacrifices on essentials like food, the super-rich have outdone even their wildest dreams. just two years in, this decade is shaping up to be the best yet for billionaires a roaring ‘20s boom for the world’s richest,” said gabriela bucher, executive director of oxfam international.
half of the world’s billionaires live in countries with no inheritance tax for direct descendants. they will pass on a 5 trillion dollar tax-free treasure chest to their heirs, more than the gdp of africa, which will drive a future generation of aristocratic elites. rich people’s income is mostly unearned, derived from returns on their assets, yet it is taxed on average at 18 percent, just over half as much as the average top tax rate on wages and salaries.
“taxing the super-rich and big corporations is the door out of today’s overlapping crises. it’s time we demolish the convenient myth that tax cuts for the richest result in their wealth somehow ‘trickling down’ to everyone else. forty years of tax cuts for the super-rich have shown that a rising tide doesn’t lift all ships just the superyachts,” said the executive director, adding, “taxing the super-rich is the strategic precondition to reducing inequality and resuscitating democracy. we need to do this for innovation, for stronger public services, for happier and healthier societies. and to tackle the climate crisis, by investing in the solutions that counter the insane emissions of the very rich.”
according to new analysis by the fight inequality alliance, institute for policy studies, oxfam and the patriotic millionaires, an annual wealth tax of up to 5 percent on the world’s multi-millionaires and billionaires could raise 1.7 trillion dollar a year, enough to lift 2 billion people out of poverty, fully fund the shortfalls on existing humanitarian appeals, deliver a 10-year plan to end hunger, support poorer countries being ravaged by climate impacts, and deliver universal healthcare and social protection for everyone living in low- and lower middle-income countries.
oxfam to this regard calls governments to introduce one-off solidarity wealth taxes and windfall taxes to end crisis profiteering. permanently increase taxes on the richest 1 percent, for example to at least 60 percent of their income from labor and capital, with higher rates for multi-millionaires and billionaires. governments must especially raise taxes on capital gains, which are subject to lower tax rates than other forms of income. similarly, taxing the wealth of the richest 1 percent at rates high enough to significantly reduce the numbers and wealth of the richest people, and redistribute these resources has been said to be essential. this includes implementing inheritance, property and land taxes, as well as net wealth taxes."
"general inflation rate decreases to 33.8 percent in december 2022 after reaching highs of 35.1 percent in november 2022, the central statistics service monthly general inflation report reveals.
according to the report, the country level food inflation recorded a high of 36.8 percent as compared to non-food inflation rate which stood at 29.8 percent in december 2022. according to the report in december, food inflation dipped to 32.9 percent down from 34.2 percent in november 2022.
as the report indicates, in december, some important cereals including; teff, rice, wheat, barely and sorghum has shown a slight decrease. similarly, vegetables; onions, garlic, cabbage, tomato, as well as coffee beans and non-alcoholic beverages have had notable decreases albeit fractional.
additionally, the non-food inflation sat up on 35.2 percent in december, a decline from 36.5 percent in november. even though there is slight decrease compared to the previous month as the report indicated there is still rise in the prices of clothing and footwear, housing repair and maintenance including cement and corrugated iron sheets, and energy, furniture and home furnishings and fuel, medical care, educational materials and jewelry including gold.
according to the agency, when compared to november’s inflation, december’s food cpi decreased by 0.5 percent and during the same period non-food cpi registered 1.8 percent increase.
inflation rate on november 2022 was recorded at 35.1 percent, after reaching 31.7 percent in october. the main factor behind december’s general inflation rate decline were decreases in food prices.
as the new year (gc) takes pace, inflation has been noted to become unendurable for the working class with food, housing, fuel, industrial input, and rent skyrocketing in price.
hard hit by the pandemic, the conflict in the northern part, crippling drought in certain parts of the country and the fallout from russia-ukraine war, the inflation has been surging in the nation.
may 2022, ethiopia recorded a general inflation of 37.2 percent, one of the highest levels in recent years. since then ethiopia’s general inflation rate has see-sawed, decreasing to 30.7 percent in september, but then climbing upwards to reach 35.1 percent in november last year.
the government as well as regional administrations have been implementing various efforts to control inflationary pressures with mixed results so far.
although there is a decrease, the percentages are small in comparison to the government targets to which the ministry of finance expects to cushion inflation to 11.9 percent until the end of this fiscal year, which seems unrealistic."
"authoritarianism across the world is leading to a “sea of human suffering”, human rights watch has said in its annual world report on human rights in more than 100 countries and territories.
but while a “litany of human rights crises” emerged over the past year, 2022 also presented new opportunities to strengthen protections against violations, the watchdog said.
hrw’s 712-page report put a spotlight on the deterioration of civil liberties for women and girls in afghanistan, as well as human rights in war-torn ukraine, the two-year armed conflict in northern ethiopia that continued to inflict a terrible toll on civilians and that governments around the world were called to do more to uphold civil liberties.
governments in latin america, africa, the middle east also have to step up and recognise that they have an important role in promoting human rights.
ethiopia
the two-year armed conflict in northern ethiopia, which began in november 2020, continued to inflict a terrible toll on civilians. a truce was reached by the main warring parties in november. state security forces and armed groups committed serious abuses, in other regions, notably oromia. authorities sporadically cut internet and telecommunication services in conflict-affected areas, with internet and other forms of communications cut in tigray since june 2021.
conflict and unrest in several regions, followed by drought also exacerbated one of the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophes. over 20 million people required humanitarian assistance in 2022.
in western oromia, fighting between government forces and armed groups resulted in serious abuses committed by all sides.
journalists, civil society organizations, and outspoken public figures in the country faced an increasingly hostile and restrictive reporting environment.
the report states that despite mounting evidence of international law violations by warring parties in northern ethiopia, as well as in oromia, government efforts toward accountability for past and present abuses have been inadequate, lacked transparency, and independent oversight.
conflict in northern ethiopia
the report mentioned that in western tigray zone, an ethnic cleansing campaign, amounting to crimes against humanity, against the tigrayan population by newly appointed officials and amhara regional security forces and militias, continued.
“on january 7, a government drone strike hit a school compound in dedebit hosting thousands of tigrayans displaced from western tigray, killing at least 57 civilians and wounding more than 42,” the report further state.
“basic services, key to people’s basic survival, notably banking, electricity, and communications remained shut off. an august report by the united nations highlighted dire food crisis in tigray, finding food insecurity in 89 percent of areas surveyed and one out of three children under the age of five acutely malnourished. in afar, clashes along the border with tigray, between tigrayan forces and afar forces, starting in late december 2021, intensified in early 2022, with reports of killings, shelling, and looting by tigrayan forces. afar forces also rounded up around 9,000 tigrayans in detention sites in afar’s regional capital, semera, in late december 2021 and held them for months. detainees received limited assistance with reports that several dozen died as a result of conditions there,” the report reveals.
“fighting in the amhara and afar regions in september resulted in further displacement, humanitarian access constraints, as well as reports of extrajudicial killing of amhara residents by tigrayan fighters, looting, and property destruction in kobo town during their control. on november 2, the ethiopian federal government and tigrayan authorities reached a cessation of hostilities agreement in south africa following 10-days of african-union led negotiations.”
security force abuses, attacks by armed groups
extrajudicial killings, mass arrests, arbitrary detentions, and violence against civilians occurred in other regions facing unrest, insecurity, and conflict, the report states.
“on june 14, government forces clashed with oromo liberation army (ola) and gambella liberation front armed groups in the gambella regional capital. after controlling the town, government forces conducted house-to-house searches and summarily executed residents suspected of collaborating with the armed groups,” the report states.
“parts of oromia experienced protracted fighting due to government operations against the ola. on june 18, heavily armed gunmen killed about 400 amhara civilians, many women and children and destroyed homes and businesses in villages in west wellega zone, in oromia, and in neighboring benishangul-gumuz region. two weeks later, on july 4, assailants attacked amhara civilians in kellem wellega zone in oromia, killing scores.”
“fighting intensified between ethiopian government forces and the ola in early november, with civilian casualties reported due to fighting and airstrikes. in western oromia there were reports of fighters from the amhara region operating in zone. the un reported that the violence in the area led to a drastic increase in internal displacement and the destruction of infrastructure.
in late july, the armed group al-shabab carried out incursions on three towns hosting regional special forces in ethiopia’s somali region, the first such attack on ethiopian territory in over a decade.”
freedom of expression, media, and association
authorities arrested several journalists, holding them without charge for several weeks despite court orders for their release. in november 2021, authorities arrested oromia news network journalists dessu dulla and bikila amenu, who covered the conflicts in tigray and oromia. dessu and bikilia were held without formal charges until april, when prosecutors charged them with offenses against the constitution and sought the death penalty. authorities released both dessu and bikila in mid-november.
journalists and individuals offering a critical or different narrative to that of the federal government faced threats, arrests, and expulsion. in may, security forces arrested solomon shumye, an addis ababa-based talk show host who has been critical of the government and the war in northern ethiopia. solomon was among 19 journalists, including gobeze sisay and meaza mohammed, detained between may 19 and early july as part of broader government crackdown in which over 4,500 people were arrested in the amhara region alone. gobeze and meaza were both subsequently released, and then rearrested by authorities in september.
on september 6, security forces broke up a peace conference organized by a group of 35 local civil society organizations in addis ababa. the event was later held online, and the group subsequently issued a joint statement calling for peace. two days later, a federal official intimidated the group to get them to retract their statement.
internally displaced persons and refugees
ethiopia continued to face large-scale internal displacement due in large part to armed conflict, followed by drought and other natural hazards. figures shifted throughout the year, with 5.6 million internally displaced persons (idps) nationally as of march 2022, in addition to 2.8 million returnees (former idps).
refugees were also impacted by conflict and unrest in the country. on january 18, a camp hosting more than 10,000 refugees from sudan and south sudan in the benishangul gumuz region was looted and burned after fighting broke out between unidentified groups and federal forces.
a january 5 airstrike on mai aini refugee camp in tigray killed three eritrean refugees, including two children. on february 3, armed men entered the berahle refugee camp hosting eritrean refugees in afar, looted belongings, killed five refugees, and kidnapped several women. the attack caused thousands of refugees to flee. at various points in september, the un high commissioner for refugees lost access to several refugee camps and idp sites in northern ethiopia due to renewed fighting. in october, un human rights experts cited reports of abductions of refugees and internally displaced women and girls fleeing conflict in northern ethiopia."
federal supreme court president meaza ashenafi and vice president solomon areda resigned from their post. tedros miheret is now appointed as president.
"benishangul gumuz region establishes a committee to undertake a process to clear the mining area of kurmuk gold mine (kgm), a large scale mine, from illegally settled artisanal miners, who occupied the area following the declaration of huge amounts of the precious metal at kgm’s mining and exploration license area.
during the latest high level delegation led by takele uma, minister of mines, fitsum assefa, minister of planning and development, demelash gebremichael, commissioner-general of the federal police commission, ashadli hassan, president of benishangul gumuz region, debele kabeta, commissioner of customs commission, million mathewos, state minister of mines, and others central and regional government officials paid a visit on monday january 9 to the company mining site 750 km west of addis ababa at kurmuk wereda of assosa zone.
following the visit, a subsequent meeting was held at the regional president office in assosa to evaluate the challenges that the company faces on matters production as per the time frame set by the central government.
on its presentation paper, the company indicated that due to a significant presence of a number of illegal miners carrying out hard rock mining using mercury within the mining license and exploration license area, it has become difficult to conduct any development and exploration activities.
in his presentation, brox worku, general manager of kgm, said that the company was supposed to start production within two years as per the license approved by the council of minister about a year ago.
“we have so far spent usd 80 million for the procurement of machines and other relevant expenses to start the blasting and planning of the mining machine. however, due to the invasion of illegal and artisanal miners, who are neither from the locality nor aligned to the site, the operation has been hampered,” brox explained the current predicament of the company.
he explained that active presence of artisanal and illegal miners within the mining and exploration area has impacted the project by delaying the start of development activities in addition to security and safety treats at the site.
“as per our plan the processing plant is bound to be erected in a short time, but prior to that at least for the coming one year, mining should be conducted since the resource will be fed to the processing plant to produce the gold,” he said, adding, “based on the projection, the company is set to start blasting within the coming five months to start the mining. however as per international law and our principle, we could not carry out the blasting since there is presence of artisanal at the site.”
“we need swift involvement from the regional administration and central government,” he underlined.
he cited that the illegal miners were not at the site about year ago, “what is the difficulty level of relocating or moving the illegal miners from the site? as a company we need a clear line about the issue.”
as per the plan, the company will produce nine tons of gold per annum for two decades and also targets to increase the volume to up to 11 tons in the coming one and half years since commencement of production.
during the visit, the presence of illegal miners was heavily observed. some eye witnesses that capital interviewed at the location said that foreigners’ particularly chinese citizens were working with the illegal miners.
the presentation document indicated that illegal miners usesudanese nationals who use mercury, and chinese who use sodium cyanide to extract gold.
he recommended that in the near future kgm will focus on the 100 km square mining license area, “so that this new coming artisanal can carry out their activity in the other location that is also under kgm’s exploration license areas but which also has gold deposits.”
he reminded that the company has already transported pilot gold processing machine for artisanal miners at the locality at a cost of one million usd with the installation set to consume usd 200,000.
“the pilot machine shall accommodate all local artisanal,” brox told capital.
he said that there are also physical attacks to his employees and vandalism at the camp site is rampant, “we need arms for our security personnel to keep the safe.”
the federal police commissioner general during the meeting expressed commitment to offer support for the security issues and arms.
demelash also recommended the regional administration in collaboration with federal security apparatus to organize a security body from retired military personnel coming from the region.
takele said that if the company commences operation it would be a good advantage for the sector, the region and country in general since it is a large scale mining business with a capacity of producing the amount currently produced.
he reminded that the council of ministers had approved the mining license through understanding that the company should commence production in two years, “but if everything is smooth and the company delays to keep its commitment we will have to revoke its license.”
“however this kind of illegal issues would be a leverage to mention as a reason for the delay, so we have to solve the problems and push the miners to get in to activity,” takele added.
he expressed his expectation that the regional administration would play its part to solve the problem as a body that has a mandate to alleviate such kind of problems.
“problems that would be solved at the central government level would be solved by the federal government,” he elaborated
ashadli said that the illegal activity has to be corrected since the project has significant advantage for the country.
“the mining site is officially transferred to kgm so it is not acceptable to allow others to enter at the licensed area,” he said.
at the meeting he also declared the formation of a committee comprising of assosa zone and kurmuk woreda heads, security advisor of the regional president, deputy police commissioner of the region, and the regional mines bureau.
“this committee will undertake a detail execution process and make sure the relocation of illegal miners as soon as possible from the licensed area of the company,” he added.
an association of artisans will also be established to use the pilot machine that the company handed over for the woreda."
"erratic showers pour in djibouti hampering logistic activities of ethiopia’s vital imports.those, who closely follow the issue from djibouti, informed capital that for the past few days, unusual rains have been hitting djibouti which is peculiar since the country is known for its low annual rainfall.the observers elaborated that the situation in the country has affected the logistics operation at ports and even road transport.roba megersa, ceo of ethiopian shipping and logistics services enterprise (eslse), told capital that the djibouti rains had affected the cargo unloading operation for one shift on saturday.“however on january 1st and today, january 2nd, the activity has fully been halted,” he added.roba reminded that currently, the port which is discharging fertilizer cargo has had its operations suspended as a result of the sudden showers.“we cannot even open the vessel hatch because the rain would damage the fertilizer cargo,” he explained, adding, “unprecedented weather conditions in djibouti have deterred our operations.”early last week, for the upcoming agriculture season, the first fertilizer vessel, mv great comfort which sailed from morocco had docked its anchorage with 57, 295 metric tons at the modern port facility of doraleh multipurpose port.roba disclosed that because of the recent weather conditions the discharge operations did not go planned, “fertilizer is a sensitive product which can easily be affected by the shower.”djibouti ports corridor road (dpcr), a body which was established a few years ago under djibouti ports and free zones authority (dpfza) to modernize the logistics roads corridor, on sunday january 1st disclosed that torrential rains caused flooding at several crossing points, “we would like to inform users of the corridor roads of the situation concerning the current bad weather throughout the national territory.”however later dpcr stated that there are some sort of improvements in some areas.recently aboubaker omar hadi, chairman of dpfza, told capital that the road condition linking both countries was noted to be a major challenge, stating, “of course this setback was as a result of harsh weather conditions catalyzed by heavy rains, which led to disruptions in road network access within our borders.”“we kept building and rebuilding the road, and the road was being washed out due to the heavy rains. similarly, to some degree the rains also affected the railway transport, with cases of over-flooding,” hadi pointed out whilst highlighting the situation of the latest weather condition affecting the activity in djibouti."
"wegagen bank’s provision expense has shown sharp reduction in the past financial year.
the year that ended on june 30, has seen the financial powerhouse netting in four folds in profits which catalyzed its recovery from previous year’s poor performances.
from the 2021/22 financial year report that the bank unleashed a few weeks ago, the bank finances highlighted that its deposit mobilization elevated by 2.4 billion birr to sit at 33.9 billion birr which is an eight percent increase compared to the preceding year.
as usual, the savings deposit took the lion’s share of the mobilization with 61 percent, followed by demand deposit which constituted 28 percent, while the deposit account stood at about 2.3 million with an unusual drop of 2.6 percent from the year prior.
“the decrease is attributable to the regulatory body’s directive of clearing customer’s account information and merging different accounts of the same person under one customers id number,” the annual report explains.
regarding the interest free banking segment, the bank’s outstanding mobilization stood at 1.6 billion birr with five percent increment while the sector financing leveled at 339 million birr.
the outstanding loans and advances rose by 2.9 billion birr or 11 percent in a single year to stand at 30.3 billion birr.
the investment in treasury bills and other securities of the bank reached 4.3 billion birr at the end of the reporting period making the total loans and advances of treasury bill and debt financing to stand at 34.5 billion birr as of june 30.
in the year under review, the bank’s asset increased by 9 percent to reach 43.1 billion birr while the paid up capital bulged to 3.4 billion birr.
in this period, wegagen amassed 5.1 billion birr of which interest income from loans and advances contributed to 73 percent for the inflow.a rare occurrence for the sector saw wegagen’s expense for the year remarkably shrink compared to the 2020/21 financial year. the annual report indicated that the total expense had dropped by over six percent or 300 million birr from 4.8 billion birr a year ago to 4.5 billion birr.
“the decrease is primarily due to a huge reduction in provision expense following improved loan collection,” the annual report justified and added the cost management practice that the bank undertook contributed for the result. for the year, provision expense plummeted by 101 percent, while expense on interest took 40 percent of the total expense. the amortization intangible assets and staff salary and benefit increased by 23, 24 and 7 percentages respectively.
in the reporting period the bank was in a good position to mitigate challenges that it faced a year ago, leading to profit attainment. as a result the profit before tax for the financial firm rose to 572 million birr which is an almost three times increase from 193 million birr a year ago.
“despite a myriad of challenges occurring during the reporting period and a year before, the bank recovered and rebounded on its growth trajectory,” the report read.
the profit after tax stood at 551.4 million birr that increased by 435 percent in contrast to 127 million birr from the previous year.
similarly, for the year in review, the earnings per share inclined by four folds reaching 16.6 percent."
"the international rescue committee (irc) released its annual emergency watchlist, highlighting the 20 countries most at risk of deteriorating humanitarian crises in 2023.
this year, somalia, ethiopia and afghanistan top the watchlist, as east africa faces the worst drought in decades and economic turmoil continues to compound needs in afghanistan.
with over a third of a billion people in humanitarian need around the world and 100 million people displaced, irc expert analysis clearly shows that the guardrails designed to prevent humanitarian crises from spiraling out of control – from diplomatic agreements and law-of-war tribunals to climate early warning systems and humanitarian aid itself – are being dismantled. beyond the individual crises to watch, the report dives deep into the three major accelerators of humanitarian crises – armed conflict, climate change, and economic turmoil – and highlights what can be done to rebuild guardrails against a runaway world.
david miliband, president and ceo of the irc said, “the emergency watchlist shows record levels of humanitarian need in 2022 and real peril ahead for 2023. a year ago we diagnosed a global ‘system failure’ – deficits in respect of state actions, diplomacy, legal rights and humanitarian operations that are driving the increased numbers of people in humanitarian need. yet humanitarian need, forced displacement and food insecurity have all worsened since then. this system failure can be seen in this year’s figures: humanitarian need has jumped by 65 million people since last year, displacement has ballooned to over 100 million people.”
he further added “in this year’s watchlist, we address the spiraling humanitarian need at ground level. the evidence we present shows that the guardrails that protect people from humanitarian catastrophe are being weakened in fragile and conflict states around the world. these guardrails are local, national and international systems designed to limit the impact of humanitarian crises on affected communities and to prevent crises from spiraling out of control. but the scale and nature of conflict, climate change and economic turmoil left unchecked in too many places is over-loading these systems. one need only look to the war in ukraine to understand the impact of the unraveling of global guardrails against conflict, and the close association with humanitarian crises.”"
"addis ababa city administration fully imposes the suspension of any property transfer in the capital.
a letter issued on december 8 by the city administration for city bureaus and sub cites now explicitly underlined that as of december 8 any transfer of property has been banned for an unspecified period.
the letter that was signed by binyam mikru, cabinet affairs head at the mayor’s office, highlighted that in line with harmonizing and taking stringent measures on the illegal activities in the capital, the ban has been applied.
recently, the city administration had applied different tactful instruments to control illegal activities particularly to land and related sectors.
for instance it had banned the service on land and land related issues on august last year which was lifted after a few months. similarly it imposed the same measure at the beginning of the ethiopian new year particularly on the power of attorney similar to instances taken in previous years.
this time around the letter that was sent to 11 sub-cites and six city offices did not however explain at length what drove to this particular decision. it only highlighted that the decision was made to provide a positive impact and to take legal actions on illegal activities being conducted in the capital.
regarding the suspension, it is stated that the ban to transfer was imposed on fixed assets but was not clear if it was for individuals or companies.
in the ban applied on september, the city administration suspended transfer of properties through individuals that have a power of attorney on behalf of the owners.
however, the ban was eased in october for those who are; disabled, unable to move because of illness, diasporas living abroad and companies that were represented by officials."
"lack of swift and bold action towards a low-carbon transition has challenged least developed countries (ldcs) according to the latest report of ‘least developed countries report 2022’ of the united nations conference on trade and development
as the report indicates, over the last 50 years, 69 per cent of worldwide deaths caused by climate-related disasters occurred in ldcs, including ethiopia. currently 46 countries have been evaluated as least developed countries of the world, 31 from africa’s, 8 from asian and seven from the islands including haiti.
according to the report, although ldcs bear the least historical responsibility for climate change, they are on the front lines of the climate crisis. they have committed to climate-resilient development pathways by 2030 and delivery on net-zero emissions by 2050.
the 46 ldcs are home to about 1.1 billion people or 14 per cent of the world population but have contributed minimally to co2 emissions. in 2019, ldcs were estimated to have accounted for about 1.1 per cent of total world co2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and industrial processes, the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions globally. even in per capita terms, the co2 emissions of ldcs barely reached 10 per cent of the world average. in contrast, the carbon footprint of an average person in a developed country or a non-ldc developing country was at least eight times larger than that of an average person in an ldc.
as the report states, while they are at the forefront of the negative consequences of global warming, ldcs contribute barely 4 per cent of current greenhouse gas emissions, yet account for 65 per cent of the global population lacking access to electricity. hence, nowhere is the need for a “just energy transition” starker than in the ldcs.
additionally, the covid-19 pandemic shock and its compounded adverse effects on trade, investment and development as the pandemic abruptly revealed deficiencies in development paradigms that have severely reduced the capacity of the state to generate domestic resources for economic, social and environmental investment.
as the report indicated, a combination of pre-existing factors and the war in ukraine, ldc populations have experienced a sharp decline in living standards and increasing inequality, while the countries’ current account balances have come under additional pressure from rising external debt payments and soaring international energy and food prices.
of the 1.1 billion people living in ldcs in 2020, an estimated 244 million were undernourished, 466 million had no access to electricity, 665 million lacked accesses to safely managed drinking water, and 874 million had no access to clean fuels and cooking technologies. these figures dramatically demonstrate the efforts that will be required to build adequate resilience to climate change, embark on sustainable adaptation, and meet the targets enshrined in sustainable development goals (sdgs).
the 27th united nations climate conference conference of the parties (cop27) – presents a unique opportunity to accelerate action towards the goals of the paris agreement, the bridgetown covenant, the doha programme of action for the least developed countries for the decade 2022–2031 (dpoa), and, more generally, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. these goals aim to achieve a mutually beneficial climate and development-friendly nexus.
“ldcs represent the litmus test against which history will judge how effectively the efforts of the international community to make the low-carbon transition take into account the development dimensions and reflect the principles of equity and differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,” the report read."
"djibouti’s port authorities underscore that harsh weather conditions catalyzed by heavy rains was the main reason for the disruption of road network access within its borders. the djiboutian delegation who were in attendance for the 16th ethio-djibouti joint ministerial commission meeting also made it clear that marine charge adjustments were not applicable to ethiopia’s vessels.
the high profile joint ministerial meeting which resumed after a three year pause following the global pandemic was held at the inter luxury hotel, addis ababa from 24 to 28 october.
according to the information capital obtained from the delegation led by demeke mekonnen, deputy prime minister and minister for foreign affairs of ethiopia, and mahmoud ali youssouf, minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation of djibouti; both countries have reaffirmed the enhancement of an inclusive cooperation.
members of the delegation from djibouti’s side have likewise told capital that the latest meeting is a sign of strong relations between the two bordering countries.
at the meeting, cooperation on regional, multilateral and economic integration between the two countries was discussed. subsequently, during the other three days, major joint ministerial meetings on political matters, transport, logistics, trade and commerce, port related issues, agriculture, border security, and infrastructure matters were looked into.
during the meeting, one of the issues raised was hurdles faced in road disruption on the djibouti side which posed a challenge to ethiopian truck drivers, who use one of the three border links, the djibouti-galafi route.
the djiboutian delegation cleared up the issue citing that relevant bodies in djibouti had made frequent maintenance on the galafi route; however natural harsh rainy conditions at the time made it a challenge.
“we frequently conducted maintenance activities on the road but the heavy djibouti rains were washing away the infrastructure which made the revamping process hard,” elaborates aboubaker omar hadi, chairman of djibouti ports and free zones authority to capital whilst highlighting the major challenge for the road damage.
with regards to the twenty percent price adjustments made a few months back on the djibouti ports marine service charge, the djiboutian delegation confirmed that it was not applicable to ethiopia’s vessels. “we reaffirm that such increments do not apply to ethiopian vessels,” one of the delegates explained.
the marine industry in recent years has faced unprecedented price hikes in connection to the global covid pandemic and the russia-ukraine war. recently the global sea transport fee has seen a rise of almost three folds in pricing."
"a shorter and less toxic treatment for people with visceral leishmaniasis was shown to be effective thanks to a study conducted in eastern africa by the non-profit medical research organization drugs for neglected diseases initiative (dndi) and its partners. the results were published in the clinical infectious diseases journal.
the new treatment consists of a combination of two drugs: miltefosine (mf), the only oral drug available for leishmaniasis treatment, and paromomycin (pm), an injectable antibiotic.
‘this new treatment is great news for the thousands of patients affected by visceral leishmaniasis in the region. it will eliminate one painful and toxic injection from the treatment and is therefore safer for those affected,’ said prof. ahmed musa, deputy vice chancellor at the university of khartoum and principal investigator of the clinical trial conducted in sudan.
leishmaniasis is the deadliest parasitic killer after malaria. its most severe form, visceral leishmaniasis (vl), is fatal if left untreated. there are 50,000 to 90,000 new cases of the disease annually, with the highest number of cases worldwide reported in eastern african countries: eritrea, ethiopia, kenya, somalia, south sudan, sudan, and uganda. the disease affects people in resource-limited settings, arid and semi-arid areas. half of them are children under 15. leishmaniasis is also a climate-sensitive disease, and its impact could get worse. therefore, if not addressed, the most vulnerable will continue to suffer.
the current first-line treatment in eastern africa consists of paromomycin (pm), an injectable antibiotic used in combination with sodium stibogluconate (ssg), administered either through injection or intravenously. it remains sub-optimal, as patients may suffer from rare but heavy side effects, such as cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and pancreatitis associated with ssg. the treatment is also difficult to administer since patients must endure two painful injections every day for 17 days.
‘the current treatment has significant socio-economic impact as patients are forced to stay in hospital for extended periods and have to miss work or school. with the new treatment patients will spend less time in hospital,’ said prof. musa.
the results announced today stem from a clinical trial initiated in 2017 in kenya, ethiopia, sudan, and uganda by the afrikadia consortium with funding from the european & developing countries clinical trials partnership (edctp). the study compared a new combination of two drugs, miltefosine and paromomycin, given for 14 days, to the standard of care of sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin given for 17 days."
"the ministry of agriculture (moa) has set the ball rolling this season with an early floatation of international tenders to procure fertilizer unlike previous regular timeframe trends as it gears to import its highest volume ever.
it’s a common occurrence to see the country issue tenders in the months of september and october for fertilizer procurement. however, unlike the past, moa has now already issued a tender to procure different type of fertilizers for the upcoming agricultural season.
mengistu tesfa, agricultural input supply lead executive at moa, said that the volume this time around will vary since the government is working to import up to two million tons of different type of fertilizers.
“we are working to import high volumes of input since there are different agricultural development initiatives in the country,” he told capital.
he added that particularly this year, the biding processes commenced early to manage the vast operation on time.
in the past, the procurement period of the country faced several challenges including sudden price hikes from the product in the global market.
recently, yinager dessie, governor of the national bank of ethiopia, told capital that the country was forced to allocate huge sums of hard currency to import the input unlike the expectation.
“in the past, our expenditure was not more than usd 500 million for fertilizer import but that narrative has changed as we have now consumed usd 1.2 billion during the past budget year,” the governor explained.
in the year, the government made available 1.5 million metric tons of different type of fertilizer for this agricultural season, while of that about 1.3 million metric tons was procured in the 2021/22 procurement season.
from the total available 1.5 million metric tons of fertilizer for the current season the distributed amount was 1.3 million and the remaining 0.2 million metric tons or two million quintal was a surplus that was transferred to the coming dry farming season and or for the major farming season that mostly commences in june.
as per the information that capital obtained from relevant bodies like the logistics enterprise and the government, the past season’s import has shown reduction when compared with the preceding two years, meanwhile the cost was incomparably higher.
in the preceding two years, ethiopia had procured 1.45 and 1.74 million metric tons of fertilizer for 2019/20 and 2020/21 agriculture seasons respectively.
mengistu said that in this coming procurement operation the government has set a target to buy up to 2 million metric tons since the agricultural activity that are held on and off the farming season are growing and as a result it is expected to push the demand for fertilizer.
“this time around we have changed our course by taking the procurement process, that is, the tender floating period, earlier than expected,” he added.
ethiopian agricultural business corporation, a public enterprise that was recently included in the ethiopian investment holding, is usually the responsible body for carrying out the procurement of the product.
for the last three years, the ethiopian shipping and logistics services enterprise, the state owned logistics enterprise and vessels operator, has been hired by the government to handle the fertilizer import which is mainly transported from morocco and ports of the black sea."
"ethiopia ranked 175th out of 191 countries on the human development index (hdi) 2021/22, placing it in a low human development category.
the hdi which is a composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development, that is, a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living, ranked ethiopia 175th overall.
according to the report published this week, in 2021 the average value that ethiopia had on the human development index was 0.498. furthermore, ethiopia had 65 years of life expectancy at birth on average while 9.7 was the expected years of schooling or 3.2 mean years of schooling. in 2021, the country’s gross national income per capital was set on 2,361.
according to the report, the human development measured the nation’s health, education, and average income which had declined for two years in a row, from 2020 to 2021, reversing five years of progress. this is in line with the global decline, indicated that human development across the world had stalled for the first time in 32 years.
recent declines on the hdi are widespread, with over 90 percent of countries enduring a decline in 2020 or 2021.
almost all countries saw reversals in human development in the first year of the covid-19 pandemic, and most low, medium and high hdi countries saw continued declines in the second year.
the last two years have had a devastating impact on billions of people worldwide when crises like covid-19 and the war in ukraine hit back-to-back and interacted with sweeping social and economic shifts and dangerous planetary changes. the latest human development report – uncertain times, unsettled lives: shaping our future in a transforming world – which was launched by undp argues that layers of uncertainty are stacking up and interacting to unsettle life in unprecedented ways.
the covid-19 pandemic, beyond its damage to people’s health and mental well-being, has also devastated economies and exacerbated gender inequality. for instance, gender inequality witnessed a near-global rise – to which the world suffered a 6.7 percent increase. south asian economies like bangladesh and bhutan bucked the trend and registered an improvement. the report also suggests that stress, sadness, anger, and worry have been increasing over the last decade, now reaching record levels. on average, countries spend less than 2 percent of their healthcare budgets on mental health, which limits access to mental health services for citizens globally. uncertainty, inequality, and insecurity go hand in hand with polarization and lack of trust. polarization and mistrust t shrink our capacity for social dialogue and stifle collective action, the report read.
globally, less than 30 percent of people think most people can be trusted, which is the lowest recorded value. the world as seen is not transitioning to a post-covid-19 build-back-better scenario. on the contrary, developing countries in every region are entering a sharply divergent social, political, and economic period with especially sharp downside risks for the most vulnerable and regression in gender equality.
“the world is scrambling to respond to back-to-back crises. we have seen with the cost of living and energy crises that, while it is tempting to focus on quick fixes like subsidizing fossil fuels, immediate relief tactics are delaying the long-term systemic changes we must make,” said achim steiner, undp administrator, adding, “we are collectively paralyzed in making these changes. in a world defined by uncertainty, we need a renewed sense of global solidarity to tackle our interconnected, common challenges.”"
"cost of school supplies touches sky highs as preparation for the new academic year meets most families in tough times.
shortage of foreign currency, lack of input materials and other factors has in recent times created the increased prices of school supplies.
the market for exercise books and education materials has steadily been on the rise for the past eight years in the stationeries across the country.
there are two kinds of exercise books in the market- the laminated and the non-laminated, with more buyers preferring the laminated ones because of durability, sellers explain. “the price of exercise book is increasing significantly within a short time,” said one seller that capital spoke to at an exhibition center recently.
“a few years back, the wholesale price of a single exercise book used to be around 10 birr, while now that narrative has changed to up to 80 birr. distribution and supply of education materials is limited in the market resulting in the inflated pricing,” the seller further elaborated.
the high cost was created by the shortage of exercise book that came following foreign currency shortages. “it is a little bit harder to find foreign currency from the banks,” said sources from one of the private paper manufacturing companies indicating that some manufacturers are cutting their production and operating below their capacity whilst looking up to government for support.
as abeba tamene, head of public relations and communication at the ministry of industry said, “the ministry doesn’t have such in-depth information on the situation. however, the ministry will try to evaluate the case.”
fortunately, parents do not have to buy text books as the government provides for those who attend public schools. the private school students do buy books for only a little above the price that the schools buy from the government, adding the transportation cost they incur.
same as exercise books, the price for other school items is higher than ever. other school items that are in high demand during the holidays are school bags and uniforms. school bags sell for 1000 to 6000 birr at the exhibition.
another market associated with the coming academic year is the uniform market.
“our markets boom in between the months of july and september, and we are currently in preparation for this,” one trader explained, signaling that prices in the uniform market still remain high."
"ministry of urban and infrastructure development develops legal frameworkthe ministry of urban and infrastructure development underscores that based on its mandate, it is working rigorously to prepare a legal framework to restrict import materials that can be produced locally.
as the ministry tailored its 18.26 billion birr budget for the 2022/23 budget year, chaltu sani, minister of urban and infrastructure development stated, “the construction sector is in high challenging situations, especially with price hikes and project management and these have had a ripple effect on us.””
“in this new budget year, we are planning on new trends by reflecting on our last year’s performance,” said the minister indicating that the ministry is focusing mainly on two issues, including properly facilitating project management and finding input materials.
“based on our mandate through proclamation 1263/2021, we are preparing a legal framework to replace imported inputs that can locally be sourced in order to resolve the challenges related with input shortage,” said chaltu, adding, “we are also working to support and strengthen the capacity of local producers.”
as experts opine, the prices of construction materials are heaping up from day to day. to this end, government has been taking a number of steps to improve the supply chain and increase the price of cement which is the main input for the construction sector.
whilst speaking about the performance of the last budget year, the minister highlighted that rebuilding of the war affected areas were successful stories despite the interruption of construction due to certain reasons.
as she indicated, among the major projects the ministry had for the year, greenery projects were the main to spread in many cities of the country besides other old and usual construction projects.
on the flip side, the interruption of project completion, and unexpected time and cost overruns of housing and road construction projects, led to more than 768 federal government projects to be paused due to the price escalation of construction inputs during the previous ten months of the budget year.
furthermore, the war in northern ethiopia was cited as a critical reason for the interruption and delay of major federal road projects. additionally, lack of clear directives for compensation and resettlement, price escalation, and absence of efficient contractors during the tender process to award project constructions, were mentioned as critical issues.
construction delays more often than not occur due to the escalation in material prices, which contractors also underline as one of the major challenges they face in their projects.
most of the stakeholders claim that there are few control measures taken by the government on the market, and they pin this as the main problem of the price spike.
the illegal increasing price of cement in the open market for the past several months has sparked challenges in the construction industry while cement producers on the other hand are tackling a long list of challenges including, unfavorable supply-demand balance, higher cement prices, escalating production costs, low utilization rates, social unrest, and a lack of foreign currency. with the new budget at hand, the ministry is working towards providing a lasting solution for the development of the country, in all fronts."
"ethiopia and kenya to sign simplified trade regime agreement to manage illegal cross border trade.
small scale trade along the kenya- ethiopia border is poised to thrive following bilateral negotiations between the two parties to agree on a common list of products to be traded under the simplified trade regime (str).
the negotiations took place on 1st march 2022 at the moyale border post and addressed the implementation of the str between two countries. the str which was launched in 2010 was done so in order to enable small-scale traders’ to become beneficiaries from comesa’s trade liberalization programme by simplifying and formalizing the trade.
according to experts, effective implementation of the str spurs growth, enhances production and productivity of the agricultural sectors through value addition and processing thereby creating jobs and increasing household incomes down the road.
ethiopia has lost up to 78 billion dollars in five years through trade mis-invoicing practices, one of the tools in executing illicit financial flows.
export under-invoice and import over-invoicing are the common activities in the illicit financial flows.
corrupted officials at borders contributed to the expansion of illegal financial flows and trade, mussie mindaye, trade relations and negotiations directorate general at the ministry of trade and regional integration, pin-pointed.
mussie explained that the absence of a comprehensive trade deal with neighbors and poor border management as contributing factors to the booming illegal trade in border areas.
ethiopia’s vast borderland makes construction of infrastructures across the border expensive and cumbersome task, according to mussie.
illegal business activities conducted in different ways in ethiopia are affecting the country’s economy to a great extent and the problem is reaching at serious level.
as stated in the discussion forum held recently regarding illegal trade and related issues, domestic and foreign illegal trade activities are becoming a thorn in the flesh for the contry economic activities.
the director of trade relations and agreements of the ministry of trade and regional cooperation of kenya, moses mendaye pointed out that the illegal trade with income and expenditure trade is a concern."
"kefi gold & copper plc, of the tulu kapi gold mine project opposes the decision of ministry of mines in the termination of its license. takele uma, minister of mines announced on wednesday, june 15, that the ministry has revoked 972 licenses of which the tulu kapi gold mining project has fallen victim.
“the government is applying lots of pressure to proceed, and we can understand that, however, we have been a bit shocked to hear the news of the termination on media to which we had no knowledge about. we did not receive any notification whatsoever which is shocking and disappointing,” said harry anagnostaras, executive chairman of kefi, indicating that kefi applies conventional industry project finance structures for the development funding.
“these companies did not comply with the terms of their exploration and production licenses despite the repeated warnings given to them,” takele said.
“kefi is processing debt from africa development banks, tdb and afc, and is capable of demonstrating full funding plans and capacity whenever requested by the government,” said the chairman adding that, “we are spending a lot of money preparing the procurement, and with hard work and diligence too. i think we are the only company working like that especially in the current status of the country.
“so far we have invested 80 million dollars and have made a good discovery and established a world class plant,” said the chairman, adding, “we were prepping for the full project launch for each project as soon all conditions were met in terms of the security situation in the country as it improves. we were planning to start construction in the dry season around october.”
authorities from the ministry argued that the main issue with kefi was the finance, to which they did not start their operation on time, in addition to not showing the capability to finance the project and not showing visible progress. “we have been giving them notices for several times and six month ago the ministry gave them the last warning to submit their financial status and ability,” stated the mines ministry.
based on the notice, the ministry had given kefi up until the end of july 8. but since the ministry foresaw that the company would not fulfill its conditions within a few days, they went through with the revocation. however kefi argues that it is in good condition to fulfill its request
kefi says it has maintained the full funding syndicate for the project. it plans to sign the funding “umbrella agreement” during the month june to demonstrate the full funding commitment, especially to the ethiopian ministry of mines.
“the ministry did not volunteer to have discussions with us,” explained the exploration firm.
after wednesday’s announcement, according to sources the ministry had sent a letter to kefi to submit their financial report until june 30, indicating that if not adhered to, the termination will continue.
kefi gold & copper plc – cyprus-based gold and copper exploration and development-company has projects in ethiopia and saudi arabia.
with a probable ore reserve of 1.05 million ounces and mineral resources totaling 1.72 million ounces of gold, kefi is advancing the tulu kapi gold project in western ethiopia towards development.
the tulu kapi mining agreement between the ethiopian government and kefi was formalized in april 2015. the terms include a 20-year mining license, a 5% government free-carried interest and full permits for the development and operation of tulu kapi.
the government became entitled to a 5% free-carry interest in tulu kapi upon granting of the mining license in april 2015. the exploration licenses held by kefi minerals (ethiopia) limited cover an area of approximately 200 square kilometers over and near the tulu kapi deposit."
"the deficit of the tabled upcoming year’s budget is widened from the universally recommended three percent of the gdp. the tax collection for the current budget year is expected to stand at 294 billion birr which is about 12 percent lower than the projection set about a year ago.
during his budget speech, ahmed shide, minister of finance (mof), told parliament on tuesday june 7 that from the proposed 786.6 billion birr budget for the 2022/23 budget year, the gap is 231.4 or over 29 percent of the proposed budget which will be covered by domestic and external sources.
he said that the budget deficit was 3.4 percent of the gdp, “the budget deficit has shown some increment in comparison to the preceding periods. the gap is widened due to the need for coverage in crucial areas in the upcoming budget year.”
according to ahmed the major portion, 224.5 billion birr of the budget deficit will be covered by local sources whereas the remaining 6.9 billion birr will be sourced from foreign creditors.
based on the deficit that will be covered from domestic source, it is stated to be 3.3 percent of the gdp.
the country has been strongly pursuant in controlling the budget deficit up to three percent of the gdp, which is of high recommendation even by international standards and partners.
however, the latest pressures bagged by covid 19, internal distraction and international partners, some of whom paused their pledges because of the northern conflict, the government is forced to look for additional resources from local financers like taking direct advance from the central bank, which experts recommended that taking huge amounts of money from the central bank would have a ripple effect on the economy including galloping the inflation.
however, the central government has been strongly controlling itself from taking finance from the central bank and has shifted to the finance amassed from alternative instruments like treasury bills. while the conflict which occurred in the northern part of the country followed by massive distraction mainly carried out by the outlawed former ruling party tplf forced the central government to access finance from direct advance from the central bank particularly in this budget year.
for the coming budget year, the central government has also disclosed that it has allocated huge amount of budget for construction projects which were damaged by the conflict.
from the total proposed budget, 400 billion birr or 84 percent is expected to be secured from tax revenue. the estimated tax collection has an increment of 19.8 percent compared with the projected tax collection for the 2021/22 budget year that will come to an end on july 7.
however, mof disclosed that the actual attainable tax collection on the current budget year will be 294 billion birr that has a reduction of about 12 percent from the projection.
the 2022/23 budget year tax collection projection will have an increment of 36.1 percent compared with the estimated actual collection of this year.
in the coming budget year, the government has set to implement tax reforms to attain the targeted revenue.
ahmed said that the reform on vat, excise tax, and introduce property tax are some of the new reforms that will be seen in the coming budget year.
in the 2022/23 budget year, the economy is expected to change its due course tracking to its projection stated under the ten years economic strategy; to grow by 9.2 percent.
mof has also disclosed that the inflation rate that reached 36.6 percent as per april’s monthly inflation figure is estimated to reduce to 11.9 percent in the coming budget year."
"witchcraft accusations and ritual attacks against african children are hidden and ignored, yet are one of the most gruesome forms of violence against children.
new research from african child policy forum (acpf) shows that every year, thousands of african children are accused of witchcraft and suffer ritual attacks, abuse, physical and psychological violence, yet most governments are turning a blind eye.
“africans have ignored this horrific violence for far too long,” said dr joan nyanyuki, executive director of acpf. “it is utterly unacceptable that witchcraft accusations and ritual attacks on children are still widespread across the continent. governments must uncover this hidden shame and address these crimes and extreme forms of violence, which have life threatening effects and often result in the death of innocent children,” she added.
the report uncovers the prevalence of witchcraft accusations and ritual attacks against children across africa. it finds shocking gaps and failures by governments, despite most countries being signatories to the african charter on the rights and welfare of the child (acrwc) and the united nations convention on the rights of the child (crc).
“many countries’ laws do not explicitly prohibit accusations of witchcraft against a child, which in itself is an act of psychological violence. worse still, beyond their failure to prevent these accusations and violent attacks, governments have also failed to minimise the harm children suffered when they fall victims,” said dr nyanyuki.
‘“african states must uphold their obligations to protect all children, especially those who are vulnerable, at risk of being accused of being witches and of facing ritual killings. among those in need of greatest protection are children with albinism who face the most gruesome forms of ritual attacks which result in extreme violence and death. such accusations and attacks are crimes and must be treated as such – they must be outlawed and punished.”
acpf is greatly concerned that despite national child protection laws, witchcraft accusations and ritual attacks against children have been reported in benin, burkina faso, ethiopia, ghana, madagascar, niger, angola, eswatini, liberia, rwanda, zimbabwe, burundi, democratic republic of congo, tanzania, central african republic, nigeria and south africa are countries.
the report highlights the case of a 13-year-old girl from benin who spent years in a child reception and protection centre after being accused of witchcraft, only to be ostracised by family and community upon her return home and eventually being forced back into care after only four days.
“the horror that children accused of witchcraft are subjected to is indescribable” said dr nyanyuki. “they suffer public humiliation, forced confessions, torture, violent beatings, are forced to ingest traditional ‘cleansing’ medicines, are expelled from their homes, ostracised from their communities, maimed and, in extreme cases, murdered. they carry the scars of isolation, neglect and victimisation on their mental health for their entire lives.”
the report acknowledges progress in tackling the abduction, murder and mutilation of children with albinism for body parts to use in so-called ‘magical medicines’ – for examples, it showcases malawi’s new laws and dedicated government action which resulted in attacks on people with albinism declining from 60 in 2016 to just four in 2021.
however, the report concludes on a sombre note, highlighting the woefully inadequate human and financial resources available to tackle witchcraft accusations and ritual attacks on children. what little support is available comes mostly from international donors.
“witchcraft accusations and ritual attacks are rooted deep in our african beliefs, culture and tradition, and are often shrouded in secrecy,” added dr nyanyuki. “they remain one of the most elusive harmful practices challenging governments across the continent. government authorities must focus on preventing witchcraft accusations if they are to succeed in uncovering this hidden shame.”"
"ministry of trade and regional integration (motri) discloses that following its announcement on taking measures on exporters who are hoarding export commodities, the fleet has begun to expand.
experts in the sector stated that the export commodities that is mainly followed up by motri has slowed down in the past few months that forced the ministry to introduce new directives and revise the previous ones on the aim to accelerate the commodities that it claims are hoarded by exporters in different warehouses located in the surrounding of addis ababa.
for instance a week ago motri revised the sesame seeds and white pea beans directive and the pulses directive. on the new amendment it has enforced traders to export commodities in a month’s time since the ministry wrote a letter.
experts said that at motri there is an assumption that export is not done as per the expected volume.
however, traders expressed their concern citing that the government does not understand the concept of stocking, “government concludes that the commodities that are stored for certain periods of time with different volumes as hoarding but that is not the case, we are stocking for different reasons, including finding market and expectations of better price rate.”
they added that stocking and hoarding should be clarified, meanwhile the ministry dismissed their concern.
“a single harvest season has to be clearly stated. for instance oilseeds shall be stored for up to two years, while when it comes for pulses the perfect period is not higher than six months,” exporters that capital spoke to explained.
according to experts, after this period, its market advantage is lesser in value and even reduces its quality when it comes to pulses.
as per the trading proclamation the harvest season is one year, while since exporters bought the product from ecx they have to expected to ship within three months time as per the directive at motri. “it is vague because if the exporter does not manage to get buyers in this period or if the price shows reduction, he shall store the product until the perfect time comes, so as to capitalize on the opportunity. in this case it is difficult to say that such kind of exporting is illegal or criminal,” experts in the sector said.
the amount that the ministry mentioned is very small and even highly dispersed to several exporters.
sources said that around the investigation in burayu there are exporters who stored tens of thousands of oilseeds and pluses and similarly there are exporters with on hand of thousands of export commodities like the place in adama but most of the volumes seen by the government investigation is about hundreds of quintal of the commodity that is lesser than a container disbursed to over 300 exporters.
experts argued that most of the companies are working with banks to buy the commodity for export so they prefer to ship the product on time to settle their loan as soon as possible rather than hoard the commodity and pay unnecessary bank interest.
the government should support exporters to export commodities as fast as possible rather than trying to take the commodities by stating it as illegal hoarding and involving against the law.
higher officials may not seen technicalities in detail so the lower officers might mislead them to which they ought to be conscience.
regarding the issue kassahun gofe, state minister of motri, rejected the concern of the traders.
he said that the ministry has undertaken its own investigation and that it knows the amount of commodities hoarded in every single warehouse.
meanwhile some exporters said that the volume that is stated by the government as hoarded in warehouses is in quintal.
kassahun strongly stated that the volume that is known under the investigation is 235,000 metric tons.
he added that it is not the issue of stocking or hoarding by definition, “there is not confusion on what hoarding really is, the commodity must be available for the market as per the rules and procedures that are clearly stated by the country’s trading and export law.”
he told capital that every week there is a consultation with exporters or their representatives and every move by motri is discussed with exporters.
“for instance the latest revision of the directives has been discussed with exporters before the amendment,” he added.
he said that there was a trend in hoarding products which was witnessed as opposed to accessing the market and exporting the goods.
“the government’s major role is facilitating and expanding new market destinations, and strengthening the existing markets with suitable conditions. on the other hand the export is expected to carry out its parts,” he said.
“we have observed that the legal market is pressured by those who want to abuse it, so we are strongly working to correct that and currently the situation is improved and we will continue to accelerate the benefit of the country and the export earning against the illegal traders and the contraband,” he said.
“ever since improvement measures were taken by the government, the consignment flow has increased,” he added.
he reminded that there was a behavior or longing in expectations that the government might introduce new policies and improve the retention law that was imposed few month ago, “such kind of expectations are the major reasons for hoarding commodities, which is totally unacceptable.”
some exporters have also appreciated the role of the new appointed state minister, who was assigned to the position very recently. as they said, he is working tirelessly to improve challenges, while on the state ministers end, he said that the measures are taken by the system and that the directions flow starting from the export coordinating committee."
"a dozen of high standard hoteliers in addis ababa are working to sell their hotels as a result of not being able to make their loan ends meet.
despite the addis ababa hotel owner’s trade sectorial association requesting the national bank for a policy decision for commercial banks to extend their loan repayment period, the plea as it stands seems to be left up in the air.
as aster solomon, president of the association explains, only 3 months remain as per the repayment period, and many hotel owners are on their way to selling their hotels as a result of difficulties of repayment. on the flip side, banks are kick starting the process of auctioning off unpaid hotels.
the severe impacts of covid-19 brought the hospitality industry to a standstill. as a result, the government decided to provide loans for the hotel and tourism sector. accordingly, the government has been able to lend 3.3 billion birr for six months from june 2020, despite the hotels request of 6.6 billion birr for one year.
“the government’s move saved the sector at the time, however, the threat to the hotel sector remains unresolved unless the loan term is extended,” said aster explaining that hotels are still in danger if their repayment period is not extended as they already have loans for construction and other purposes other than the pandemic rehabilitation loans.
“even if lenders understand the problem of hotels and want to extend the repayment period, they will not be able to do so without a directive from the national bank of ethiopia,” aster explained.
“commercial banks have understood the difficult situation that the hotel and tourism sector has found itself in. likewise, the addis ababa city tourism bureau is also working to find a way to support the association,” aster expounded on the matter.
as the hotel industry, both here and globally continue to recover from the hard hitting pandemic, most if not all hotel industries are operating in nil profits with their revenues dwindling drastically. the hotels are not making profits at this difficult time and are thus not able to repay their loans which could increase the non-performing loan of banks which could result to the closure of hotels.
operators in the sector recommended that it would be commendable if the banks can relieve them of loan repayment, reduce interest, and the government to provide assistance to the hospitality industry with failure to do so proving catastrophic for the industry."
"new study recommends the government to control its squandering spending as part of mitigating the inflationary behavior whilst reviewing the levy on import commodities is hinted as an additional input to price stabilization.
the study conducted by the ethiopian economics association (eea) under the title: ‘the ethiopian economy: structural constraints, inflation, and policy options’ highlighted the current challenge in the market with possible way forwards to ease the circumstance.
the study that uses resources from government offices and international organizations said that the slowdown and drop down in some pillar economic sectors have been observed for the past close to a decade from the growth trajectory in the first ten years of the millennia.
the eea, through its study flashback, showed that the agricultural sector has fizzled by half from 60 percent contribution to the gdp in 1990, while the industry sector has shown ups of two folds to about 30 percent as that of the service sector, which stands at the top, takes 40 percent of the gdp contribution, up from 30 percent in the past.
“the growing trend on the services sector for the share on the gdp is an indication that the economy in general is in structural challenges,” the statement that eea issued by referring to the study outcome said.
production volatility and sharp reduction in some agricultural products’ productivity was also revealed on the document. this is also similar to industrial production increments up until 2010, which then started reducing from 2016.
the reduction on the supply side whether locally produced or imported items has contributed to the inflation.
it said that different researches indicated that the growth of industry and service sectors in ethiopia is contributing to the price hikes, while the growth of agricultural sector productivity with additional factors played a key role to stabilize the market.
the drop of birr’s purchasing power against international currencies and devaluation was also stated as one of the factors to ballooning the inflation.
the study revealed that ethiopia was one of the top ten african countries which amass significant revenue from import-export taxes and it seats at the fourth level by imposing huge customs duties.
as per the study, imposing a massive levy on import items and expanding tax revenue yield higher chances in contributing to inflation.
eea’s research also identified that the growth of export trade might fuel the price hike, “due to that it explained that proper policy thinking and direction is crucial to balance it.”
of the top ten countries in africa that have poor export performance, ethiopia stands at the third level.
regulating the money supply and monetary policy based on the market was recommended as a basic principle for the issue.
however, in its recommendations, the study said that reckless spending from the government and society, in general, should be corrected as an alternative to keep the galloping inflation. while it gives priority to agricultural productivity by emplacing proper support for smallholder farmers, which are the major source of agricultural products in ethiopia. improving power usage was also among the suggestions put forth.
even though the government is a crucial body in introducing and applying different policy instruments to tackle the challenge, external support has also been stated as essential.
it study suggested that even though the government remains the major player on the issue, the formation of supporting an independent body is vital to curb the challenge.
it recommended for the formation of a board, supply and price stabilization board, as an independent body to support the government.
eea study added that the role of the board will be providing support for trade balance administration, providing policy recommendations as per a detailed evaluation of the circumstance, and coordinating different relevant bodies.
playing a role to stabilize the market or at least setting maximum inflationary points if curbing the inflation is not fruitful was also stated as an area where the board can contribute."
"research findings released by world animal protection has laid bare the most damaging human health impacts linked to industrial livestock production systems, including emergence of antimicrobial resistance (amr), increased zoonotic pathogens and rising human illnesses from consumption of livestock derived foods containing food safety hazards in africa.
the report, the hidden health impacts of industrial livestock systems, exposes how governments around the world are turning a blind eye to the public health toll of factory farming as well as the suffering of billions of farmed animals. the report builds on the concept of five pathways “through which food systems negatively affect our health” as outlined by the world health organization (who) in their 2021 report food systems delivering better health.
it further shows how these negative health impacts will only get worse as the demand for meat continues to grow. for instance, by 2030, meat consumption is projected to grow by 30% in africa. this skyrocketing demand has billions of stressed animals mutilated and confined to cramped and barren cages or pens for their whole lives. over seventy percent of the 80 billion land animals farmed globally are raised and slaughtered within cruel industrial livestock production systems annually.
world animal protection details how these negative health impacts are directly linked to industrial livestock production systems, characterized by substandard husbandry practices and poor animal welfare, and has further identified that african governments are most significantly fueling the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (amr) and increasing foodborne illnesses.
dr. victor yamo, farming campaigns manager, world animal protection said, “the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in africa is driven by weak regulatory capacity of government agencies charged with the responsibility of managing the production, registration, distribution and utilization of these products leading to the rampant misuse of these products. for instance, the law requires that antimicrobial drugs be purchased against a prescription, but our farmers can purchase the same over the counter without a prescription.”
he adds that “the situation is further compounded by the inadequate extension personnel on the ground to advice the farming community on innovative and good animal welfare, animal husbandry and animal health practices such as good biosecurity, proper nutrition, housing, stocking densities, hygiene & sanitation and infection, prevention & control (ipc) strategies which would render the need for use of antimicrobial drugs unnecessary.”
the report highlights that three-quarters of the world’s antibiotics are used in farmed animals, either to prevent them getting sick, promote fast growth or treat disease – a practice driving the emergence of superbugs (antimicrobial resistant bacteria), which leaves us less able to fight infections. new research has found that 1.27 million people die each year from superbugs, and it is estimated that by 2050 this will be the leading cause of death globally. on top of this threat, industrial livestock production systems squash animals into tightly packed sheds, risking disease like swine flu or bird flu that can jump to humans.
animals cruelly packed in such shades are often immensely stressed leaving them prone to infection by bacteria or parasites that can cause foodborne illness in humans, such as salmonella. an estimated 35% of all foodborne diseases globally are linked to meat, dairy or eggs, which is costing lower income countries billions of dollars annually in lost productivity and medical expenses.
dr. lian thomas, scientist at the international livestock research institute (ilri) in nairobi said: “industrial livestock farming requires the production of a high density of genetically homogenous animals, which leads to the quick spread of diseases – many of which can directly affect human health. the health of farmed animals and their environment must be a high priority for the public health sector. sustainable food systems which promote good animal health and welfare, and environmental protection, will directly protect human health.”
systemic shifts are needed to deliver the biggest health gains for our population. some of those include re-orientating subsidies away from factory farming towards humane and sustainable practices, improving affordability of plant-based foods, and providing transition support for farmers no longer wishing to engage in factory farming.
to make these shifts, world animal protection is calling for african governments to impose a moratorium on industrial livestock production systems, introduce and enforce higher farmed animal welfare standards like the farm animals responsible minimum standards (farms)
jacqueline mills, head of farming, at world animal protection, said: “industrial livestock production systems are not only cruel to the animals that they produce but are also making us sick. on the surface, the meat, eggs, fish and dairy products produced by these systems seem cheap, but they are costing us our health and our governments trillions of dollars each year to mop up the damage they cause.”
“we need to break the cycle of suffering of the animals in our food system. the food industry needs to embrace a humane and sustainable future where farmed animals are kept in genuinely high welfare systems where they can have good lives. now is the time for governments to focus on better health outcomes for farmed animals, people and the planet. we need a moratorium on industrial livestock production systems.”
african governments should recognize the inter-connectivity between public health and planetary impacts of industrialized farming systems and commit to stopping the support for these systems. the commitment in the form of a moratorium on industrial livestock production systems should be within the national climate action plans (known as nationally determined contributions (ndcs)) in recognition of these systems contribution to climate impacts. as well as this, the african governments must develop and implement national one health, one welfare action plans and national antimicrobial resistance (amr) plans that recognize the health impacts of industrialized livestock and restrict its growth."
"the first three months of the year show a decline in sales of agricultural machinery compared to the same period in 2021. the market contraction is organic compared to the record levels reached in the first quarter of last year. incentives continue to support the market but geopolitical uncertainties may weigh on the coming monthsthe machinery market held up well in the first quarter of the year, albeit with a drop compared to the record volumes reached in the same period of 2021. registration figures, processed by federunacoma on the basis of registrations provided by the ministry of transport, indicate a total of approximately 5,400 units sold for tractors, down 9.9% compared to the first quarter of last year when registrations were up 57.6% on 2020.
in the first three months of 2022, sales of combine harvesters reached 41 units, down 26.8% compared to the previous year (in the first quarter of 2021 they had grown by 180% compared to 2020), while registrations of tractors with loading platforms reached 132 vehicles, down 10.2% compared to the first three months of 2021 (+21.5% compared to 2020). trailers and telehandlers also remained at high levels, closing the first part of the year with 1,944 (-8.2%) and 309 (-18.7%) units sold, respectively. also for these two types of machines, the drop in 2022 has a relative weight, as it refers to a quarter that in 2021 had seen record increases in registrations (compared to 2020: +37.4% for trailers, +86.3% for telehandlers).
after a 2021 marked by extraordinarily high sales volumes for the agricultural machinery market, the setback observed from january to march can therefore be considered organic, as demand for agricultural technology continues to be strong. the transition towards agriculture 4.0, with investments for the purchase of the latest generation of mechanical equipment, and the simultaneous presence of several financing instruments for the purchase of agricultural machinery (credit for 4.0, nuova sabatini, nrrp, psr, bando isi-inail) contribute to supporting this demand. however, as the year progresses, sales trends will inevitably be affected by very significant economic factors.
“we find ourselves in a contradictory economic phase since, while the demand for machinery is going well, price volatility and difficulties in the supply of raw materials, which have been greatly exacerbated by the war in ukraine, are threatening market growth,” explains alessandro malavolti, president of federunacoma.
the commodity emergency is not only affecting the agricultural machinery industry, making production processes much more expensive, but is also affecting the agricultural sector which, driven by a generalised increase in costs (especially those relating to energy and fertilisers), is seeing its own investment capacities decline. “in this scenario it is necessary to combine very short-term strategies with a long-term strategic vision, also aimed at exploring new channels and supply methods for raw materials,” sensitized malavolti."
"ethiopian electric power (eep) announces that production tests on drilled aluto langano geothermal site has commenced.
the state owned electric power producer revealed that the power export has been cut by half starting from this week to keep sustainable power supply in relation to the two religious festivities.
the aluto langano, the only developed geothermal site in ethiopia, which started its expansion work last may, has so far accomplished the drilling of four wells.
moges mekonnen, public relation head at eep, told capital that the production tests of the four drilled wells will be commenced and that the testing that will be undertaken on two weeks interval. “the testing period may take three months,” moges stated.
in total 12 wells will be drilled under the project that will be fully finalized at the end of the coming year. currently, the fifth well is being drilled and the drilling of the sixth well commences soon. “the drilling work was commenced with delays owing to the water supply not flowing at the expected time which is crucial for the project,” the public relation head explained.
the kenyan firm, kengen which has carried out the drilling works using two geothermal drilling rigs has allowed the project to run swiftly.
located about 145km south of addis ababa on the aluto volcanic complex in the main ethiopian rift valley, aluto-langano is the only producing geothermal field in ethiopia and experts express that it is probably the best studied prospect in the ethiopian rift. geoscientific exploration began in 1973 and led to the siting of an exploration well la3 on top of the volcanic complex.
the well was drilled in 1983 to a depth of 2, 144 meter. since 1990, aluto had produced electricity which has now been interrupted in connection with the expansion project.
the undergoing expansion that consumes usd 218 million with the major share being covered by the world bank of ida support through ‘geothermal sector development project’ plans to generate about 70 mw.
in related development, eep disclosed that the power supply to djibouti and sudan has dropped by half starting from this week.
moges said that eep, which is responsible to generate and transport power up to the substation besides manage the energy export, to keep the local sustainable power supply in these holiday season has cut the export by half.
he said that the power supply to the two neighbors will continue after the end of the holidays.
he reminded that the peak hour for electric demand used to start at 6 pm, “however since the ramadan season started the peak hour has come up to 3 pm.”
“taking the growing power demand to consideration eep has been undertaking massive preparation for the fasting season and two christian and muslim holidays to provided sustainable power,” he explained.
“as per the preparation, the team has been formed, and each unit at the generation plants, sub stations and transmission lines have been tested and made ready,” he added.
optical fiber cables have also been tested.
a standby team has been formed and dispatched at stations and technical facilities to handle any interruption when it occurs.
“grid stability stations like gibe iii and tana beles have also been specially tested since they are vital for restoration if any interruption occurred,” he said, adding, “as per our experience in similar holiday seasons in the past years, the power demand is from 2,500 to 2,600 mw but now me have made available up to 2,800 mw of power to mitigate the sudden demand.”
besides the 2,800 mw ranges, eep has provided a standby reserve if any additional demand shall be needed.
since eep is responsible to produce and provide electricity up to distribution stations; it has disclosed that it is working with ethiopian electric service, energy retailer, to ensure sustainable power supply for the two holidays."
"high price increase of household products dim the celebration of easter. both demand and supply from the consumer and supplier standpoints show increase even when compared to previous holidays such as that of christmas.
it is always a familiar sight to see the markets full to the brim during the last days of the holiday. however this time round most of the consumers seem to be complaining about the prices of commodities. furthermore, the traders themselves are complaining that the market condition has escalated above proportion.
the food items price spike continues to be a headache to majority of the population. in most of the huge markets in the city as capital has observed the market is showing double price increase even when compared to the christmas festivities from few months back.
both food items and non-food items are shooting in price as supply of the commodity is showing shortage. furthermore there are instances of high stake-overs in terms of the price of vegetables and grains including, teff, and other necessities which has lasted over a month has financial burdened the population in addition to the continued surge in the prices of edible oil and spices (pepper).
even though government is taking different mechanisms to stabilize the oil market it doesn’t seem to be working, since five liters of oil has hit highs of 1200 in the market. to put that into perspective similar periods of last year would cost a customer 400 birr per 5l. likewise onion has shown a jump from 35 birr to 45 birr per kilo while a kilo of butter now ranges from 600 up to 800 birr up from 450-600 birr from last year.
as a result, in a country that has seen double digit inflation rates for the last two years, meat markets has seen a spike in the prices of sheep and cattle, the latter fetching between 25,000 and 100,000 birr.
mostly cattle, butter, eggs and chicken come to the city from various parts of the country, mainly from harar, gojam, arbaminch and jimma. however, the uprising conflicts in the country have made traders to fear to move from place to place thus the price of some products are increasing by double and some are showing significant increments.
kera, akaki, shegole, bercheko are the largest cattle markets receiving cattle from different parts of the country, mainly from harar, wellega, bahirdar, jimma, gonder and wolayita among others. usually, sale of livestock inside the center reflects significant seasonal variations on demand and supply.
as capital has learnt in most markets, the price of cattle is showing 50 percent increase when compared to christmas. usually, the price is based on the type, size and origin of the cattle.
the price of sheep ranges from 5000 to 15,000 birr while goats cost between 4000 and 10,000 birr. in most cases the price of an ox has shown the highest price increase as even the smallest in size is said to cost 40,000 birr which was 25,000 birr on christmas.
“recent unrest in some parts of the country has made it difficult to receive cattle from parts of the country. and on the last two days of the holiday the price is expected to be raised even more,” expressed one trader in an interview.
in most markets of the city traders are selling an egg between 8 and 9 birr which was 6 to 7 birr last year, whereas a chicken would set consumers back between 800-1300 birr based on their size which was between 450 to 650 birr last year.
apart from the traditional markets in the city these days, digitalized market platforms are also becoming preferable.
hellobeg is one of these platforms. a group of young entrepreneurs started selling live cattle per kilo sparking a new buzz in trend starting from last ethiopian christmas. for this holiday hellobeg has prepared more than 3000 sheep and goats and 200 oxen. according to general manager zekaria ahmed, hellobeg sells the cattle with about 30 up to 50 percent discounts from the traditional market. however price increase in the market and shortage of supply has presented a big challenge for the easter market. as he indicates, when they started their operation in christmas, the price of sheep was 150 birr per kilo and due to the increasing price of cattle it is now 200 birr per kilo. the price of goat per kilo is now 250 birr whilst that of an ox is 130 per kilo. hellobeg also has a delivery mechanism for its customers.
similarly, mama’s chicken has also presented about 2000 chickens with affordable price for the holiday according to the general manager, daniel tadesse. as he refers most of the chicken in the normal market is up to 900 birr while that of mama’s chicken is sold at 600 birr including 10 eggs.
it is a well-known fact that ethiopia has been going through many economic, social and political events since last year. the biggest problem for the people has been the rising cost of living.
retailers and traders say that inflation and the high cost of living have weakened consumer purchasing power and that people who go to various malls for shopping have already halved their purchases.
being a holiday season in the form of easter and ramadan the market is expected to increase because of perceived increase in demand against shortage in commodity."
"contractors working on government university projects halt construction owing to price hikes in construction materials.
according to girma habtemariam, president of the contractor’s association, contractors working on more than 700 projects of government universities have stopped their operations.
as girma elaborates so far contractors have about 756 projects in universities across the country with the total cost of the projects being worth about 92 billion birr.
as an option, contractors have requested the government to revise their agreements. ” we have submitted a letter to the ministry of finance to revise the agreement, mainly the price,” stated girma.
the ministry has also been in talks with pertinent stakeholders on the issue and as girma clarifies, his association has high hopes that the issue will be solved sooner rather than later.
“the prices of construction materials are heaping up from day to day,” lamented the head of the association.
construction delays more often than not occur due to the escalation in material prices, which contractors also underline as one of the major challenges they face in their projects. according to the central statistics service’s latest update on the month of february, the price of construction materials has shown an increase of 17.9 percent up from 15 percent in january.
most of the stakeholders claim that there are few control measures taken by the government on the market, and they pin this as the main problem of the price spike.
the illegal increasing price of cement in the open market for the past several months has sparked challenges in the construction industry. to this end, government has been taking a number of steps to improve the supply chain and increase the price of cement which is the main input for the construction sector.
cement producers on the other hand are tackling a long list of challenges including, unfavorable supply-demand balance, higher cement prices, escalating production costs, low utilization rates, social unrest, and a lack of foreign currency.
the ministry of mines said the problem related to cement production and supply is due to the fact that the association of manufacturers and producers does not pay attention to cement production. in a letter to 14 cement factories a week ago, the ministry said man-made problems in cement production and supply were on the rise, coupled with the lack of close supervision of cement production, factory management and limited producers.
based on the problems, the ministry of mines conducted a joint survey with the relevant institutions in a letter to the companies, highlighting the major problems identified in the study.
“the main problem is that the management members and sector leaders of the cement factories have not paid due attention to the production of cement. we are waiting on the government to make the rearrangements on the contract, considering the current situation,” opined girma."
"according to the global hunger index (ghi) report the state chronic food insecurity and malnutrition in ethiopia is categorized as serious. with a score of 21.1, ethiopia ranks 90th out of the 116 countries with sufficient data to calculate ghi.
also according to the report, since 2000 ethiopia’s ghi score has decreased by a 29.4 points decline of 55 percent. “the ghi score is failing at an ever slower rate meaning that progress in the fight against chronic food in security and malnutrition is at a deceleration while levels of malnutrition continue to be high and concerning,” underlines the report.
according to the index, nearly 40 percent of the population in tigray afar and amhara are affected by the conflict and face an emergency level of acute food insecurity. emergency out comes are also expected in the worst affected drought areas in the south and south east parts of the region.conflict, desert locust inversion, climate shocks such as flood and drought, covid-19 impact, decline in budgetary support and the large nation trade deficit, driving high inflation and depreciation are key drivers of humanitarian needs. also the current conflict between russia and ukraine further threatens the global and ethiopian food insecurity with the disruption in the agriculture supply chain which about 25 percent ethiopia’s wheat import comes from ukraine in addition to the rising food price around the world.
ethiopia loses about 16.5 percent of its gdp each year to the long term effect of chronic malnutrition and stunning while it suffers losing 55.5 billion birr associated with child under nutrition.
as the report indicates, in 2021 ethiopia experienced the largest annual increase in the number of people facing food crises or worse.
the mid-year review of the ethiopia humanitarian response plan for 2021 showed that humanitarian partners were providing 12.8 million people with food assistance, 8 million of whom receive other types of assistance.
in addition 2 million people receive nonfood assistance despite the fact that 2.62 million people are internally displaced."
"zonal bureau for agricultural resource development in oromia region takes measures on ethiopian coffee and tea authority’s (ecta) officer on the allegation of abusing his power and involvement in smuggling contraband to the centre. the issue has raised eyebrows and scrutiny on the proper usage of coffee dispatch letters.
in the letter that was issued on friday april 8, west guji zone agricultural resource development bureau of oromia region stated that it has suspended wogene alemu, ecta representative at bule horra dispatch station.
the notification letter that copied guji zone administration, bule horra city administration, the city police and prosecutor, ethiopia commodity exchange (ecx) of bule horra branch, and bule horra dispatch station of ecta, accused the individual with involvements in misdemeanor acts for several occasions in addition to damaging the interest of the country.
the letter that was signed by ayano alemayehu, deputy director for the bureau leading as the coordinator for the coffee and tea sector in the zone that is the major source of guji type of coffee, wogene was noted to abuse his position by issuing fake coffee dispatch documents to smuggle contraband to the centre.
the zone agriculture bureau is also the focal body to regulate the coordination of the coffee and tea business.
the letter added that the individual was suspended on the accusation of illegal act, has produced forged documents and stamps that he issued for trucks to pass to the centre with illegal consignment rather than the bean.
as per the information that capital obtained from the area, wogene is already under custody as a suspect for the latest incident which happened on monday. on the stated day, the customs commission hawassa branch seized the contraband clothing that was covered by coffee husks, while the driver that transported the contraband commodity presented a dispatch document that was signed by wogene with the stamp and header of ecta.
the case has raised the concern that such kind of illegal acts shall create a gap for those who are involved on illegal activity. according to the concerned body, in the past when coffee passed through ecx, the procedure was tight before issuing the dispatch document. at least the commodity should be staffed at the ecx warehouse to transport to the central market or processing terminal, “since the vertical integration trading scheme does not have such kind of processes, illegal actors are using the opportunity the smuggle contraband under ecta coffee dispatch document as a cover.”
experts on the matter explain that in the past few months, similar illegal attempts have been confiscated by customs check points at hawassa and shashemene.
experts recommended for ecta to improve its controlling mechanism regarding issuing requiring green light documents.
west guji zone currently contributes up to 60,000 metric tons of coffee to the central market per annum."
"the direct advance channeled to the central government at the first quarter of the fiscal year surges by two and half folds.
the first quarter report of the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) which analyzed the economy in detail indicated that at the first quarter of the 2021/22 fiscal year that included months from july to september shows nbe’s gross claims on the central government bulging by 36.0 percent to 311.9 billion birr.
from the stated amount, the government bonds accounted for 63.6 percent while direct advances took 36.4 percent.
“direct advance to the central government rose sharply by 266.1 percent compared to last year same period due to huge government expenditure demand,” nbe explained.
the national bank noted however that the deposit of financial institutions at the nbe contracted by 12.5 percent on annual terms despite 19.1 percent quarterly increase.
the quarterly report shows that the direct advance on the stated period stood at 113.5 billion birr that was 31 billion birr in the same period of last year and 83.5 billion birr at the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, which is the preceding quarter from the reported three months.
it was recalled that through introducing different instruments the government had enabled to successfully reduce the direct advance sharply in the preceding quarters, though it showed slight increment in the past few periods.
unforeseen events like the conflict in the northern part of the country in addition to rehabilitation and aid, and drought was stated to have forced government to access finance through direct advance from the central bank. experts however, recommended government to reduce its direct advance as much as possible since it’s consequential on the economy.
therefore other instruments like treasury bills (t-bills) were recommended to be used for the budget deficit.
according to the nbe quarterly report, during the first quarter of 2021/22, the amount of t-bills supplied to the biweekly auction market was 226 billion birr, showing 581.3 percent annual increment.
similarly, the demand for t-bills was increased by 156.5 percent to 136.6 billion birr while the total amount of t-bills sold reached 130.6 billion birr, showing a 291.6 percent surge over similar periods of last quarter.
banks bought t-bills worth 93.5 billion birr while the remaining t-bills valued at 37.1 billion birr were sold to non-bank institutions.
“as a result, 40.8 billion birr (net of redemption) was mobilized for government budget financing. the total outstanding t-bills at the end of the quarter reached 161.5 billion birr, reflecting a 316.6 percent increase over last year same period,” the report elaborated.
the average weighted t-bills yield was 9.18 percent, about 46.2 percentage points higher than a year earlier that was 6.3 percent mainly due to the policy change on issuance of t-bill through auction market.
at the end of first quarter of 2021/22, broad money supply (m2) reached 1.4 trillion birr exhibiting a 28.4 percent annual growth, owing to 29.6 percent expansion in domestic credit and 17.0 percent in other items.
similarly, the reserve money reached 287.1, billion birr showing 9.8 percent annual expansion while excess reserve of commercial banks depicted 54.8 percent, annual contraction.
during the review quarter, banks disbursed 65.3 billion birr in fresh loans, indicating 18.7 percent annual increase. of the total new loans, the share of state owned banks was 56.1 percent and that of private banks 43.9 percent.
in the first quarter of 2020/21, the share of state owned banks as fresh loan was 30.3 percent and that of private banks was 69.7 percent."
"with all the dire situations in the country, ethiopian electric power (eep) discloses that in a positive light most of the mega projects are running as per projection. at the half year mark, the energy service export has reeled in over usd 46 million with no incidence of nationwide blackout being reported.
moges mekonnen, public relation head of eep, said that despite challenges popping in different corners of the country, mainly on the northern part of ethiopia, the power generation entity has recorded smooth running of its mega projects.
“our big projects that are being undertaken in different parts of the country are running without any halt. for instance, the gerd is running as per schedule, similar to koysha hydro-electric project whilst government on its end has given required attention and support,” he told capital.
moges likewise called on the public to continue accelerating its moral and financial support for projects, saying, “for instance, currently gerd is at 84.2 percent completion, thus the public should continue their contribution aggressively since the project is on the early generation work stage.”
“our concern on delay of projects is at the sites located in amhara, afar and tigray,” he added.
projects like bahir dar-woldya-komblocha 400 kv transmission line, which is 85 per cent accomplished, has been looted by the terrorist group as they expanded their territory through aggression to amhara region.
similarly, the mekele-dallol transmission line project that stretches to semera-afdera has fully been stopped.
because of the aggression, 1.6 billion birr worth of damages were incurred in amhara and afar regions, while the infrastructure status at tigray and some areas in afar where the terrorist group relaunched its aggression is not known.
in the first six months of the budget year eep has generated 7,673 gwh energy which is 84 percent of the target. “the generation projection was 9, 080 gwh, while some part of the areas in afar and amhara were out of service because of the aggression, thus our generation was reduced for the sake of power saving,” moges explains.
similarly, the generation was reduced due to the two power stations operating in tigray not being included in the report for the stated period.
in the first half year usd 46.4 million was earned from power export to djibouti and sudan. the revenue earned from the export has increased by ten percent compared with the same period of last year.
“from energy export to djibouti increased by 10 percent to usd 26.9 million compared with the same period of last year,” moges explained.
ethiopia is also on the process to embark power sales to southern neighbor, kenya.
moges said that in the budget year, eep has projected to earn usd 138 million from service export of the three countries, while the export to kenya is yet to commence.
“if the export to kenya commences in the coming months the earnings will be expanded,” he explained.
last year, usd 90.5 million was secured from energy export.
the public relation head stated that in the past six month it has achieved massive success in generation and operation, “for instance in the last budget year, during the first half, two nationwide blackouts had occurred which has not transpired during this period.”"
"the covid-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts for all economic sectors, but as front-line workers, it has had acute impacts on journalists. journalists’ financial, physical and electronic safety and security has been challenged, leading to poorer news content and impacting their capacity to fulfill their role as they should in reporting in an emergency of this nature.
while the media have been hamstrung, misinformation and disinformation have proliferated online, which have led to countless infections and even deaths with journalists struggling to deal with the tide of falsehoods.
these are some of the findings of a study by the african editors forum (taef), reporting at a distance: the impact of covid-19 on journalists and journalism in africa. the report will be launched on february 23, 2022, together with the safety guide for journalists covering pandemics in africa.
“the impact of covid-19 on journalists and journalism in africa, which was continent wide and the first of its kind and was funded by unesco’s international programme for the development of communication (ipdc). the safety guide for journalists covering pandemics in africa was co-funded by unesco’s multidonor programme on freedom of expression and the safety of journalists (mdp) and
the #coronavirusfacts project supported by european union. taef is not only happy to provide the study, which will be a necessary tool for journalists and researchers. the guide will be a useful weapon in the arsenal of the media as they cover pandemics,” said taef chairperson jovial rantao dr sandra roberts, author of the research report, said: ‘not one of the journalists interviewed in the fifteen participating countries, spread out in all regions of africa, was left unaffected by the pandemic.
one of the key challenges of the pandemic has been the ability and in some cases the tendency of governments to restrict the movement of journalists and pose a risk to their safety.
a female journalist in zimbabwe said “every time there is a roadblock, you then have to produce your id, you then have to produce a letter … and sometimes they had to verify that…people were told no, go back, you can’t proceed.”
the journalist continued to explain the increased surveillance, especially during lockdowns, meant that journalists’ own, and their sources’, safety could be compromised.
dr adedamola adetiba, co-author of the safety guide for journalists covering pandemics in africa, said:
“the guide is a resource material for journalists, and anyone interested in reporting during health emergencies in africa.”
the guide provides safety advice, not only for reporting during covid, but on numerous other infectious diseases.
the guide provides some insights on how african journalists may best protect themselves going forward, while the report maps the challenges experienced by the media and proposes solutions for sustaining good journalism in the continent.
roberts said, “the changes in the sector present an opportunity as there is now a pool of un- and underemployed journalists, whose talents can be utilised in a potentially industry-changing way.”
taef invites journalists, editors, media activists and members of the public to join guilherme canela godoi, chief of the section of freedom of expression and safety of journalists at unesco, at the launch of the research and the guide."
"crafting a trade policy has been underlined as a crucial move to augment ethiopia’s trade and export.
during the discussion that addis ababa chamber of commerce and sectoral association (aaccsa) held with regards to the export sector, shibeshi bettemariam, acting secretary general of aaccsa, on his inception presentation expressed his hope that the new incoming policy will bring change for trade in general and for export in particular.
shibeshi said that lack of similar policy was one of the major reasons for the stagnation of ethiopia’s export in terms of earning and diversification. challenges like low production, productivity and low value addition, limited quality and standards of export goods, and lack of comprehensive trade policy were stated as the achilles’ heel of the export sector.
for the 8 year period of 2010/11-2018/19, the import and export of ethiopia’s goods and services had grown by 4.3 percent and 10.46 percent respectively.
he said that the trade balance has consistently been negative, with average deficit per year standing at usd 10.6 billion. of these, the peak was usd 13.8 billion in 2015/16, while imports have been more than double the exports in almost all years.
figures that were included on the study conducted by the chamber indicated that in the last ten years the export trade contributed on average only 5.5 percent of the gdp, which is razor thin when compared to other countries.
“at the same time the import trade contribution for the gdp is 23.3 percent on average which shows the largest gap between export and import,” the acting sec. gen remarked.
he added that compared to regional economies such as tanzania, uganda, rwanda and kenya, ethiopia’s export performance as a percentage of gdp was the lowest, implying our economy has been classified as relatively closed.
“the country is joining continental and international free trade areas but because of productivity and efficiency at the current status we can’t compete with other countries around the region,” he said, adding, “the gap on the private sector must be identified and solved.”
he emphasized that the private sector is the pride of the country and the flag carrier in the global market competition rather than the government, thus it is wise to keenly focus on export development through the private sector.
“to attain the required growth, a trade policy is crucial,” shibeshi said.
according to the expert, who is an economist by profession and an investor, trade policies are a necessity, and even seat atop of the international relations agenda for countries that even have trade policy negotiators that specialize on market intelligence and statistics, in addition to lawyers in diplomatic missions. he emphasizes that as a country, we ought to emulate the same.
ethiopia export’s puzzling challenge is one that is seen to be solved through structural arrangement and policy.
the agricultural productivity is crucial to expand the expected growth since the ecosystem of the country is a good advantage followed by agricultural processing.
trade logistics improvements in the areas of technology like the telecom infrastructure are crucial to conduct frequent and speedy communication. allocating efficiently the earned foreign currency through administrative measure has also been stated as a supportive measure that will expand export.
the trade policy that is currently under drafting stage is the main pillar for the export sector.
the new policy will center different government directions and policy contents that are related with trade and export.
“currently trade and trade related issues are included under industrialization policy, different five year development plans, and other policies that shall be governed independently and proactively through structural manner in the new trade policy,” he added.
shibeshi reminded that there were efforts to expand the export commodity diversification, though they could not materialize as per the expectation because of different reasons. he gave an example of the failure in the pharmaceutical sector which faced the market challenge and access to finance. however in the past over a decade up to three sectors like horticulture products, and textile and garment have diversified the composition of ethiopian export.
export facilitation services are stated as crucial and are to be largely included on the trade policy similar to other countries. export trade results have been in flux since 2011 to which the trajectory showed some improvements in 2020 and in the last budget year.
the government through ministry of trade and regional integration is responding to disappointing results in both local and international commerce by drafting its first trade policy.
the policy will evaluate everything from scratch and indicate the end goal of the commercial sector and will show the actors and contributors in commerce.
crafting the policy started in 2019 and has taken much time to which experts said that it has faced delays since the policy work ought to include international experts’ view thus having wider validations.
besides the export trade, in the local market hording, smuggling, overstating price increases, and uncontrollable and lack of adequate supply in terms of goods and services have been major problems over the past several years. the ministry has attempted to come up with solutions by imposing laws and controlling mechanisms to smash illegality and or supply products on its own but things have not improved."
"more than 4 out of 10 families living in communities across the southern nations, nationalities, and peoples’ region (snnpr) ran out of food during 2021 because of severe drought exacerbated by high inflation, according to the latest survey from the long-running university of oxford project young lives.
in december 2021, young lives’ researchers interviewed 326 young people and their families from ethiopia’s hard-hit south-western region. they found 75% of families were concerned about running out of food (see table below). and some one in three young people said they, or other household members, went to sleep hungry because there was not enough food.
young lives director, dr catherine porter says, ‘these alarming figures represent a staggering increase in food insecurity compared to when we contacted the same families at the end of 2020, before the drought set in.’
she adds, ‘efforts to support those in need are already under tremendous strain, compounded by the ongoing conflict, notably in tigray and continuing economic and social impacts of covid-19, with services disrupted, insufficient social protection and a humanitarian system already overwhelmed.’
alula pankhurst (phd), young lives country director in ethiopia adds, ‘we are deeply concerned for the vulnerable families who are part of our survey as they grapple with the immediate, unprecedented and devastating effects of climate change, conflict and covid-19. we are equally worried about the potential negative long-term impacts of severe malnutrition on children’s growing bodies and minds, as witnessed by our long-running study.”
unicef estimates almost 850,000 children are at risk of severe malnutrition in ethiopia this year, with urgent humanitarian assistance needed for more than 6.8 million people by mid-2022.
young lives is a 20-year study following the same children across four countries, ethiopia, india, peru and vietnam. the team in ethiopia has been was unable to contact study participants in the entire region of tigray and at sites in amhara as communication is all but impossible in the north of the country because of the more than year-long conflict.
findings from young lives’ unparalleled longitudinal research show early childhood stunting due to under-nutrition, especially amongst the poorest children, has a significant negative impact on the development of important cognitive skills, such as vocabulary and basic mathematics, as well as socio-emotional skills such as self-esteem, self-efficacy and agency, right through into adolescence. this impact may even occur during pregnancy or as a result of malnutrition experienced by adolescent girls even before they became pregnant, underlining the critical importance of targeting support to girls and young women."
"ethiopian shipping and logistics services enterprise (eslse) announced that the logistics fleet operation was commendable despite the conflict escalations in the past few months.
the state owned mammoth logistics enterprise said that despite the war affecting its operation, the shipments that are transported to the country is promising.
roba megersa, ceo of eslse, disclosed that there was a tendency of reducing the cargo shipment since the country was in war.
the volume of fertilizer cargo that was expected to arrive in djibouti has been slowed down and similarly containerized cargos have shown reduction but when compared with the situation of the country, “the operation is commendable,” he remarked.
he stated that even though he does not have detailed information on the procurement, some portion of fertilizer has been delayed which slightly reduced the activity of eslse. he reminded that the shipment of fertilizer has been delayed for one month, and the procurement of urea is not yet concluded.
“in terms of containerized cargo about 70 percent was fulfilled, which is great achievement if we compare with the condition where we were in the past months. it is good for the country since we were in the war economy,” roba told capital.
he said that in this coming month, three vessels carrying ethiopian fertilizer will be docked at djibouti.
similarly relief cargos for those affected by the war are also expected to accelerate eslse’s activity in the coming months.
the global outbreak of covid 19 is currently stated as a serious challenge for the logistics sector and global trade with similar case being observed on the ethiopian market mainly on shipments price hike.
the pandemic has also decelerated the operation in the logistics sector in ethiopia and djibouti, which is the major outlet for ethiopian cargos.
on her latest appearance at the urban infrastructure and transport standing affairs standing committee of parliament, dagmawit moges, minister of transport and logistics, said that the shipment of fertilizer that was expected to arrive at ports in djibouti in october last year has been delayed. she added that up to 30 vessels caring fertilizer are expected to dock at the port in the coming few months.
the fertilizer is badly needed at the centre before the upcoming harvest season which is fast approaching. experts said that currently the demand of fertilizer for the country has increased because of the latest initiative that the government introduced, which is farming through irrigation scheme in the dry season.
in relation to the economic activity of djibouti, recently the international monetary fund stated that growth is expected to recover to about 4 percent in 2021 on a rebound in investments and construction, but the outlook for 2022 is less favorable and subject to downside risks due to the conflict in ethiopia and a possible resurgence of the pandemic. once the regional security and health situations are secured, growth prospects are strong, with a competitive port sector well-positioned to benefit from a rebound in regional and global trade."
"somali region announces that it will take strict measures on those involved on petroleum contraband.
sources said that despite the region accessing required fuel from the oil companies, which are distributing the petroleum imported by the ethiopian petroleum supply enterprise, shortage mainly in the capital jigjiga is observed.
according to sources in the regions, the problem is directly related with the illegal activity that some retailers or their employees are involved in including illegal activity of selling the product beyond the border.
late this week mustafe muhumed omar, president of somali region, on his social media page stated that the regional administration will take strict measures on those involved on petroleum contraband.
the trade and transport bureau of the region has also said that the region and jigjiga have ample supply of petroleum, while shortage is seen because of the contraband which will be corrected moving forward.
it has been stated that benzene and naphtha of petroleum is one of the contraband commodity fleet from ethiopia at the border area in the south, south east or west.
the main reason for that is that the ethiopian government is subsidizing the product. the subsidy makes the product significantly cheaper than the price in neighboring countries market.
due to that traders who have chains at the oil retail stations are smuggling the product to regional markets. the information that capital obtained from the region indicated that the volume that petroleum crossing the border is growing from time to time which directly reflected in the local market negatively.
the information obtained from the somali region president’s office also stated that in the past few weeks, huge volumes of petroleum that was being transported in by different ways, including big trucks, have been sized.
now the regional administration has warned that the government will take serious measures including confiscating trucks that are involved in the smuggling of the product. moreover licenses of the stations which are involved on the illegal activity will be revoked besides other legal measures.
recently the central government has announced that it has designed to apply a quota on oil distribution for stations in somali and oromia regions mainly for the towns that are highly attached with the contraband activity. the quota will allow the government to limit the amount it delivers for those border areas. the decision will impose a burden for regional administrations to tighten their regulation to curb the contraband on the aim to keep the public from petroleum shortage.
ethiopia allocates almost similar proportion of foreign currency income secured from export earnings to oil import."
"the price of coffee at the ethiopian commodity exchange (ecx) has spiked by almost a thousand birr per feresula (17 kilograms) in the first half of this budget year when compared with the same period from last year.
owing to the bad weather which has backpedaled brazilian coffee as well as logistical constraints, the global coffee prices have sharply increased starting from the past budget year. on the other hand, the global circumstance has also benefited ethiopia in terms of generating more hard currency from coffee export in the period starting from last year.
an attribute to this success is also the efforts of the ethiopian coffee and tea authority and regional bureaus which encompass the coffee production and trading which has led to increment of trading, both in volume and value.
similar to last budget year’s performance which saw the country securing over usd 907 million, the current budget is surpassing the expectation with marvelous trends.
in likewise manner to the price increment in the international market, the price of the bean in the local market has also registered significant increment including on the modern trading floor, ecx.
as per capital’s evaluation of coffee price trends which are drawn from the past one year’s market data of ecx, the country’s top hard currency earner has surged in price, on average by over one thousand birr.
the ecx market data that capital evaluated indicated that few weeks ago the average price of export coffee, which is arabica, at ecx was about 3, 400 birr to the maximum and close to 2,000 birr to the minimum per feresula (17 kg) based on their origin and quality.
most of the price has over a thousand birr difference compared with the same period of last year.
it is to be recalled that capital through inside sources, reported that the volume of export coffee available through the trading platform has shown reduction in the current budget year. sources state that the reduction of coffee on ecx has narrowed in the past few months as a result of the drifting away of oromia region from the platform to the recently introduced alternative vertical integration market scheme. the volume of coffee at ecx naturally plunged because oromia region is one of the major sources of the coffee bean.
however, most of the coffee coming from other regions like snnp, sidama, south west, gambela and benshangul gumuz still mainly trade through the electronic trading floor which is widely recognized for its trust in terms of payment.
experts in the sector said that the price of coffee at the initial market of the vertical integration or at ecx has climbed on average more than a half in the first half of the budget year compared with the same period of last year."
"ethio engineering group (eeg) and hst consulting team up to undertake a study to identify pivotal areas of focus for the industrial giant.
it is recalled that the group was formed about two years ago when the manufacturing giant and ill-functioning metal and engineering corporation, well known by its abbreviation metec, was separated in two, that is, as military and civil industrial conglomerates.
before and even after the split, the current government has been noted to have given prudent attention to formerly metec, with regards to reform activities so as to get the public enterprise back on its effective track.
according to the latest information, eeg, which now manages the civil manufacturing industries, has agreed with the prominent and inclusive consultancy firm hst to conduct a study that enables the group to make transformational changes on its operation.
based on the agreement, hst shall conduct an indicative study and reassessment on the enterprise’s business portfolio which shall shape the company’s strategy and enable it to achieve the reform activity that it already commenced over three years ago.
as per the agreement between the two bodies, the local consultancy firm will also provide practical assistance to attain the reform work through revised strategy and preferable direction.
metec was criticized over the years by commentators on the industry by the way it conducted its business activities, which ranged from delving into new business projects without evaluation of the current endeavors in businesses it had at the time, in addition to speculations of misuse of resources and corruption.
one of the top criticisms was that the corporation showed interest to undertake works or production and projects from very big projects down to the very small ones, which was noted by some to be all over the place.
experts criticized that the state enterprise was engaging in all sectors even in the very small ones that are undertaken by sme and the lower level private sector.
the upcoming indication study may help eeg to sort areas and operations that it manages as a big group which controls about nine huge manufacturing industries.
early this week, the management of the eeg and hst conducted an inception meeting on the upcoming study. eeg stated at the initial meeting that the failure of the enterprise, which previously engaged on every field without restriction or prudent study beforehand, was looked into at the discussions.
the study will also include and evaluate the technological capacity of the enterprise and show the way forward in terms modernizing the group. eeg announced that based on the consultancy study, a strategy will be developed.
hst is a well-known local consultancy firm which is involved on different momentous studies independently and in partnership with prominent international firms.
recently, eeg has had a change in leadership as new ceo, misganu arega (amb), replaced hiwot mossisa, who served the enterprise before and after the split. currently, hiwot has been assigned to represent ethiopia at the international civil aviation organization based in montreal, canada.
eeg manages about nine heavy and light manufacturing industries including; agricultural machinery factory, basic metal and machine building, automotive, and power engineering.
solomon gizaw managing director of hst said that the task they are given is huge and added that it is in its early stage to further comment.
with international competency, hst has been providing several supports to the private sector including huge international companies and public sector for almost 18 years now."

"the provision expense of wegagen bank triple slashing the profit by 82 percent for the financial year that ended in june 2021.
the bank that disclosed the 2020/21 financial year report a week ago, stated that its total expense surged by 44 percent in the stated period.
in the 2019/20 financial year the bank’s total expense was 3.3 billion birr which ballooned to 4.8 billion birr in the financial year that ended on june 30, 2021.
according to the annual report, although the provision expense took 18 percent of the total expense of the 2020/21 financial year it has contributed to increase in the total expense significantly.
the report stated that the provision expense increased by 307 percent compared with the preceding year due to the non performing loans (npl) rate showing increment in the year.
a year ago the share of provision expense for doubtful loans and advances was only 6 percent of the total expenses which went on to stretch to 18 percent in the past financial year.
in the reported year, the bank was forced to hold 864 million birr as provision expense due the npl while but a year ago this amount was 231 million birr.
from the total expense, the salary and benefit took the lion share followed closely by interest expense and general expense with 31 percent, 30 percent and 20 percent respectively.
in the financial year ended on june 30, 2020, it is worth recalling that the interest expense stood at the top taking 37 percent share from the total expense amount.
according to abdishu hussien, chairperson of the board of directors of wegagen bank, the provision expense increment has significantly affected the bank’s profit in the reported period.
in the year, the bank managed to secure 193.1 million birr in profit before tax which is a huge chop of 82 percent when compared with 1.07 billion birr in the preceding year.
abdishu said that npl mainly occurred in relation to the conflict in northern part of the country. he said that the bank was unable to collect loans provided for customers in the stated conflict area.
in the year the bank totally secured five billion birr in revenue which increased by 13 percent in comparison with 4.4 billion birr of the 2019/20 financial year.
similarly, the deposit mobilization has shown a five percent increment to stand at 31.5 billion birr.
according to the annual report, the total outstanding loans and advances increased by 15 percent to reach 27.3 billion birr.
at the end of the reported year, the total asset of the bank has reached almost 40 billion birr with four percent growth on year to year basis.
at the reported period, the paid up capital of wegagen increased by 400 million birr to reach at 3.3 billion birr. in the year wegagen’s profit after tax has stood at 126.7 million birr showing significant shrinkage from 832 million birr on june 30, 2020."
"addis ababa hotel owner’s trade sectorial association requests the national bank for a policy decision for commercial banks to extend the loan repayment period.
ever since the first case of covid-19 was reported in march 2020, hotels have been facing a drastic fall in room occupancy rates, while the income of businesses involved in the industry dried up due to decline in the number of tourists. thus the hospitality industry players requested the government for a provocation package that can help them rescue their businesses and retain their staff at these trying times since travel restrictions, flight disruptions, social distancing and lockdown directives have brought down the local hospitality industry to its knees.
therefore the government decided to support hotel owners and tour operators who sought government assistance to withstand the severe impacts of covid-19 which brought the hospitality industry to a standstill.
as a result, the government decided to provide loans for the hotel and tourism sector. accordingly, the government has been able to lend 3.3 billion birr for six months from june 2020, despite the hotels request of 6.6 billion birr for one year.
“although the government’s move saved the sector at the time, the threat to the hotel sector remains unresolved unless the loan term is extended,” said aster solomon, president of the association. hotels are still in danger if their repayment period is not extended as they already have loans for construction and other purposes other than the pandemic rehabilitation loans.
“even if lenders understand the problem of hotels and want to extend the repayment period, they will not be able to do so without a directive from the national bank of ethiopia,” aster explained.
as aster said, after doing the necessary assessments, the association has written and submitted a letter to the national bank of ethiopia that shows hotels are facing a national crisis, “to this end we are yet to receive a response,” the president of the association said.
“we have requested the government to avail loans, and postpone the loan repayment in order to keep the hotels afloat,” stated aster.
“commercial banks have understood the difficult situation that the hotel and tourism sector has found itself in. likewise, the addis ababa city tourism bureau is also working to find a way to support the association,” aster expounded on the matter.
as the hotel industry, both here and globally continue to recover from the hard hitting pandemic, most if not all hotel industries are operating in nil profits with their revenues dwindling drastically. the hotels are not making profits at this difficult time and are thus not able to repay their loans which could increase the non-performing loan of banks which could result to the closure of hotels.
so it would be commendable if the banks can relieve them of loan repayment, reduce interest, and the government to provide assistance to the hospitality industry and failure to do so can prove catastrophic for the industry."
"government has formed a committee to assess ways to support investors and exporters in order to minimize the effect of ethiopia’s suspension from the african growth opportunity act (agoa).
on december 23, 2021-u.s. president joe biden announced that he has determined that ethiopia, guinea, and mali do not meet the agoa requirements. due to the conflict that erupted last year between the federal government and the tigray people’s liberation front (tplf) requirements described in section 506a(a)(1) made ethiopia ineligible to be part of the act.
aimed to support investors to resist the effect of ethiopian termination from the agoa, a committee has been established from the prime minister’s office, ministry of finance and the ethiopia investment commission.
in order to find alternative market options especially for the textile industries, rearranging tax and tariffs, expanding duty free schemes, giving loan relief, minimizing transport subsidy and also minimizing shade leasing cost are some strategies to be used.
since ethiopia is not a wto member state, the country’s standard tariff schedule for access to the us market has far higher tariffs than would be the case under normal tariff relations (ntr). a loss of agoa removes preferential access to 6,500 tariff lines.
following the temporary suspension of ethiopia on november 2, 2021, ethiopian officials had warned that the suspension could take away 1 million jobs, disproportionately hurting poor women who are the majority of garment workers.
experts at the time explained that one of the efforts that the government is working on was to change the decision of the us government and also going forward, perhaps finding alternative market and increasing the product is the mainstream market which will be impactful for the future.
in a statement issued by the ministry of foreign affairs, “removing the preferential agreement will affect the livelihoods of more than 200,000 low income families, mostly; women who have got nothing to do with the conflict, it will also considerably impair the lives of one million people who are engaged in the supply chain ecosystem.”
the ministry expected a balanced view on the situation from the international community and asked the us government to reverse its decision that may only embolden the terrorist group while endangering the aspirations of ethiopians to extricate themselves out of poverty.
agoa brings ethiopia about $100m in “hard cash” annually and directly generates employment for about 100,000 people. ethiopia exported 237 million dollar duty-free to the u.s. last year, u.s. commerce department data said.
almost half of ethiopia’s 524 million dollar in exports to the us in 2020 utilized agoa preferences – mainly for apparel and footwear, two sectors reliant on agoa preferences with most of the exporters found in industrial parks.
from the total 24 industrial parks developed in the country, 22 are now in operation and the country has managed to attract more than 250 domestic and foreign investors which till august 2021 created employment opportunities for 86,837 unskilled laborers and more than twenty thousand posts for skilled labor and graduates, excluding the three industrial parks in tigray region which have ceased operations for the last one year.
according to the industrial parks development corporation (ipdc), inclusive of the ones in the industrial park context, currently more than 65 textiles and apparel, and 67 major leather products, and gloves manufacturing industries employ over 200,000 direct jobs of which 80 percent of them are women and youth and generate about 230 million dollars per annum."
"the ethiopian civil society organizations council’s executive committee requests the international community, government, csos, stakeholders, private sector, media and citizens to be deliberate over the roles that they play with regards to the current situation of the country.
“the war that has been going on between tplf and the ethiopian defense force has resulted in adverse effects that should be addressed with utmost care and without delay. as a result of this war, lack of peace, instability, displacement of myriads of women and men, including children and the elderly, have been observed in the different regions of ethiopia,” said the council in its statement.
“since the war started, the international community has been taking wrong stands and measures that did not rationally take account of the realities which have already put the country and the lives of its people at stake,” added the statement.
“unnecessary threats of sanctions and embargoes have been directed on ethiopia with the very aim of pressurizing the government to stop the war and settle the dispute through negotiations, while no visible effort is seen to have been made to exert the same pressure on all the conflicting parties. however, the impositions have not brought about the desired result as they had planned them. as a result we call upon the international communities and countries to come one step forward to really understand the reality on the ground and refrain from taking unnecessary measures to jeopardize the lives of millions of ethiopians,” the council opined.
the council appreciated regional organizations including the african union for its endless efforts and contributions that it has been making to fairly address the current situations of the country.
“its efforts have brought about a change as au has been discharging its duties in impartial manner and has continued to be committed to work hard to restore peace and stability in our country to do more than ever to support the overall effort the government is making to restore peace and stability in ethiopia,” the council remarked.
as the council stated some present fake news with misleading information with the aim of damaging personalities, distorting facts, and spoiling the country’s image since the very day the war started. “the behaviors of some international media have also been seen to be far from being observant of fair and ethical reporting whereby deliberate and unsubstantiated reporting have been observed,” the council blasted.
“we denounce international and some local media which have been providing false information to our people and we urge all media, mainstream social media, to comply with journalism ethics to discharge their duties accurately, impartially, by being fair, accountable and responsible. we ethiopians live together in harmony and support one another despite our creed, religion, culture and languages,” said the council in its statement adding its readiness to help the people who are in need. “we also would like to reiterate the importance of protecting our country and its people from possible danger that is hovering over them.”"
"new report on covid-19 in africa shows widespread willingness to get vaccinated, underscoring need for consistent supply and additional logistical support.
as the omicron variant dominates the covid-19 news cycle, new research from the partnership for evidence-based response to covid-19 (perc) indicates that people in african union member states are overwhelmingly willing to get vaccinated. across 19 countries, 78% of people surveyed by perc indicated that they had been or were willing to get vaccinated.
however, as of november 2021, less than 7% of the african continent has been vaccinated. this gap between acceptance and coverage demonstrates a substantial unmet need and underscores the importance of consistent and predictable vaccine supply as well as increased support for vaccination programs in africa.
“we must work urgently toward equitable access to safe and effective vaccines on the african continent,” said dr. john nkengasong, director of the africa centres for disease control and prevention. “the perc data show that demand for vaccines is substantially higher than supply.”
at 78%, vaccine acceptance was higher than in the previous perc survey fielded earlier this year (67%), which may indicate the success of risk communication campaigns.
among the 20% of respondents who expressed vaccine hesitancy, the top reasons were: low risk perception (24%), not having enough information about vaccines (22%) and lack of trust in government (17%). the reasons for low risk perception are complex, but officials can take concrete action to address them. offering more and better information to people about covid-19 and vaccines through trusted sources, particularly health care providers, coupled with consistent and reliable vaccine supply, can further increase acceptance. respondents’ top information sources included local health centers, television and radio.
a number of bottlenecks have contributed to the failure to achieve higher vaccination coverage. unpredictable supply in terms of volume, timing and shelf life threatens countries’ ability to meet demand. when offered, vaccination is frequently inconvenient, requiring people to travel far distances or visit vaccination sites at inopportune times.
covid-19 preventive measures remain crucial to mitigate the health impact of the virus. perc researchers analyzed what influences support for and adherence to such measures and found that individual actions hand washing, mask-wearing and social distancing all garnered support from at least 90% of survey respondents. such high support suggests that these key measures can continue to be effective strategies for reducing covid-19 transmission.
preventive measures restricting gathering or movement received less support. unemployment and food insecurity were widespread among survey respondents and made adherence to restrictive community measures a challenge. perc researchers concluded that such measures should be targeted to specific, high-risk populations as needed to minimize harm.
income loss also may have had an adverse impact on access to essential health services. cost and affordability were cited as the primary obstacles to receiving care. declines in the number of health visits have likely contributed to declines across key health indicators. perc researchers advocate for urgent investment to stabilize health systems and regain progress lost during the pandemic.
“the perc data enable policymakers to both save lives and minimize impacts on livelihoods,” said dr. tom frieden, president and ceo of resolve to save lives, an initiative of vital strategies. “the global community has an opportunity to invest in health care workers and public health infrastructure to support vaccine delivery and covid-19 care and prevention in the near term, and also repair and restore health service delivery disrupted by covid-19 for the long term.”
perc authors recommended global community should support au member states in supplying vaccines at a better coordinated and more systematic pace to allow broader, more effective and equitable distribution. covid-19 preventive measures are critical to mitigate covid-19 transmission, ministries of health have competing priorities-both maintaining longer-term investments in endemic diseases, such as hiv and tuberculosis, strengthening health data systems to be better prepared for health threats is critical. the global community and national governments should invest-to the fullest extent possible-in public health infrastructure and social protection programs that build and maintain resilience,
perc polled approximately 23,000 people across 19 african union member states; compiled social, economic and epidemiological data from a range of sources; and compared results from previous surveys conducted in february 2021 and august 2020."

"hawassa industry park has transferred employees of us-based, pvh corp following the firm’s decision to close its manufacturing facility in ethiopia as of november 25, 2021 to other companies operating in the industry park.
fitsum kebede, ceo of hawassa industry park told capital, pvh had over 1300 registered employees who following their termination were transferred to other companies based in the park during the past couple of weeks.

as sources from the industrial park development corporation inform capital, the company has set covid-19 and the international market as its main reason for its closure. the company notified the corporation about its departure a few months ago after the sale of its facilities to another company.
the company had announced its closure without giving any clue to its employees as workers of pvh formed a labor union to ask about their future.
beside the employees, the company is also in negotiation to transfer the sheds and all of its workers to other companies. however, the name of the company taking over the space has not been disclosed.
pvh like most of its peers called hawassa industrial park which is located south of addis ababa, home. the hub which was designed by the government to attract garment and textile manufacturers has defined ethiopia as a textile and garment manufacturing hub.

in overall context that has led to closure of the schools in the first place, the government has been moving swiftly to protect civilians from atrocities being committed by the terrorist group tplf in several parts of the country. on november 2, 2021 the government declared a nationwide state of emergency. the six-month state of emergency allows, among other things, for roadblocks to be established, transport services to be disrupted, curfews to be imposed and for the military to take over in certain areas. anyone suspected of having links with “terrorist” groups could also be detained without a court warrant, while any citizen who has reached the age of military service could be called to fight.
on similar news, starting from monday november 8, 2021 the ministry gave the first round of the 12th grade national examination which ended peacefully.
according to the ministry, in the first round 565,255 students took the national exam which was 96 percent from the expected number.
also in areas the national exam has not been administered due to various problems, it will be given in the second round after making psychological readiness of students."
"all parties to the conflict in tigray have committed violations of international human rightsthe ethiopian government stated that the us government’s decision to suspend ethiopia from agoa is misguided and fails to take into account the commitment of the government of the us values the wellbeing of ordinary citizens.
in a statement issued by the ministry of foreign affairs, “removing the preferential agreement will affect the livelihoods of more than 200,000 low income families, mostly; women who have got nothing to do with the conflict, it will also considerably impair the lives of one million people who are engaged in the supply chain ecosystem.”
it said that it expected from international community a balanced view on the situation in ethiopia.
the statement issued further said that what ethiopians expect from the international community and the us in particular at this time is an unbiased assessment of the critical situation and supply of the much needed humanitarian support to affected people.
“unjustified intimidation to jeopardize the economic livelihoods of innocent citizens, which we believe is propelled by the enemies of ethiopia behind the scene, will not give a peaceful resolution to the conflict,” it added.
and it asked the us government to reverse its decision that may only embolden the terrorist group while endangering the aspirations of ethiopians to extricate themselves out of poverty.
“the government of ethiopia is deeply dismayed by the failure of the united states to properly acknowledge efforts made to address concerns on both the humanitarian aid and human rights issues in connection with the conflict,” it said by reminding that reducing security checkpoints from 7 to 2, among others has shown the government commitment to address the concerns of the international community over some bureaucratic hurdles.
it recalled that the government support for the joint investigation by the un human rights office (unhro) and the ethiopian human rights commission (ehrc) into alleged violations of human rights committed in tigray.
the report issued by the joint human right bodies mid this week disproved most of the allegations that were fingered on the ethiopian government. it generally highlighted that there were not that much incidents that was claimed by the international community and media the statement from mofa said.
the joint investigation by ehrc and the unhro has found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that all parties to the conflict in tigray have, to varying degrees, committed violations of international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, some of which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
in a report published, which examines the devastating impact the conflict has had on civilians, the joint investigation team (jit) details a series of violations and abuses, including unlawful killings and extra-judicial executions, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, violations against refugees, and forced displacement of civilians.
the report covers the period from 3 november 2020, when the armed conflict began between the ethiopian national defence force (endf), the eritrean defence force (edf), the amhara special forces (asf), the amhara fano and other militias on one side, and the tigrayan special forces (tsf), tigrayan militia and other allied groups on the other, until 28 june 2021 when the ethiopian government declared a unilateral ceasefire.
the jit visited several locations, including mekelle, eastern tigray (wukro), southeastern tigray (samre and nearby areas), southern tigray ( alamata, bora and maichew), western tigray (dansha, humera and mai kadra), and bahir dar and gondar in the amhara region, as well as addis ababa. the jit conducted 269 confidential interviews with victims and witnesses of alleged violations and abuses, and other sources; and held over 60 meetings with federal and regional officials, representatives of international organisations, ngos, community-based committees, medical personnel, and other sources.
“as the conflict expands with more reports of violations and abuses, this report presents an opportunity for all parties to acknowledge responsibility and commit to concrete measures on accountability, redress for victims and the search for a sustainable solution to end the suffering of millions,” said daniel bekele, chief commissioner of the ehrc. “ehrc remains engaged in monitoring the human rights situation since end of june and will be sharing its findings in due course,” daniel said.
“the tigray conflict has been marked by extreme brutality. the gravity and seriousness of the violations and abuses we have documented underscore the need to hold perpetrators accountable on all sides,” said michelle bachelet, un high commissioner for human rights.
“as the conflict has escalated, with civilians as ever caught in the middle, it is vital that all parties heed the repeated calls to end hostilities and seek a lasting ceasefire,” said bachelet.
the jit recommends that all parties to the conflict to end all violations and abuses and to take all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. it calls on them to agree, without preconditions, to immediately end hostilities and end any measures that may exacerbate the already acute humanitarian crisis."
"the united nations world food programme (wfp), the un refugee agency (unhcr), and arra, the national agency for refugee and returnee affairs, appealed for us$68 million to avoid food ration cuts for over 700,000 refugees in ethiopia.
the agencies warned of growing risks including increased malnutrition and anemia, stunted child growth, deterioration of the health status due to susceptibility to diseases/infection and a myriad of protection risks further compounded by the covid 19 pandemic.
funding shortages will force ration cuts of up to 60 percent of people’s required daily intake, meaning some 710,000 refugees impacted by the cuts will only receive 1,262 kilocalories per person/day. the cuts, starting in november, will impact all refugees living in camps in gambella, afar, shire, melkadida, assosa and jijiga in ethiopia.
the ration cuts are a last resort to avert a complete break in food supplies across the country. however, even with this reduction, if wfp doesn’t receive an additional funding it will completely run out of food for refugees by january 2022.
“we are appealing to our donors to quickly come to the aid of the refugees, who solely rely on wfp food and cash transfers for survival,” said steven were omamo, wfp’s country representative and country director for ethiopia.
“sadly, prolonged ration cuts affect the refugees’ nutrition and health. the immediate priority for us all must be to restore assistance to at least minimum levels for refugees, many of whom lost the lifeline of remittances due to the global impact of covid-19.” said omamo.
if there is an immediate response from donors, however, wfp would be able to buy food available in the region and quickly transport to meet the refugees’ urgent dietary needs and avert the ration cuts. wfp would also be able to transfer cash to refugees immediately so they can buy the food they need from local markets and meet their urgent dietary needs.
“we are grateful to donors for continuing to provide funding to meet the food and non-food needs of refugees”, said unhcr’s representative in ethiopia, mamadou dian balde. “however, the lack of funding to sustain food assistance will greatly undermine the overall protection needs of the refugee population in ethiopia, with negative effects to the peaceful coexistence between refugees and hosting communities, and plausibly reverse the gains made in reduction of malnutrition.”
unhcr, wfp and arra continue to prioritize the food needs of refugees, in accordance with their tripartite memorandum of understanding, and have established effective food assistance identification systems through the biometric verification, which ensures accountability and entitlement of the food and cash assistance to refugees on a monthly basis. unhcr is calling on all partners to increase efforts to address the medium- to long-term food needs of refugees, in line with the government of ethiopia’s 2019 refugee proclamation, and the commitments contained in the global compact on refugees (gcr) and its comprehensive refugee response framework (crrf). “we must all do more, in support of refugees and their host populations”, said balde.
at present ethiopia provides protection to more than 800,000 refugees, the majority of whom are from south sudan, somalia and eritrea. of these refugees, 710,000 are fully dependent on the food assistance.
arra, the government refugee agency, is distributing the food both in kind and in cash in a more accountable and transparent manner. the refugees’ full profile is registered in the level three registration, and assistance distribution is based on the biometric database. arra will continue to ensure asylum-seekers and refugees have access to level three registration to meet their protection and assistance needs.
arra, wfp and unhcr continue to count on the donor community for the extended funding support for the refugees in the principle of shared responsibility to implement basic humanitarian life-saving activities.
“arra strongly appeals to the donor community to extend their generous hands to the refugees, in the principle of shared responsibility before the refugees impacted seriously by continuing cut off from the recommended minimum food basket,” said eyob awoke deputy director of arra.
wfp also provides specialized fortified foods to young children, and pregnant women and nursing mothers, to stave off malnutrition. as an additional measure to avoid a pipeline break – nutrition support will be limited to only children under two years of age (instead of the current under five years old) as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women.
the triple burden of food insecurity, under nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies is expected to worsen, behind the background of the already high global acute malnutrition (gam) rates in 16 of the 24 (2/3) refugee camps. in 19 of the 24 camps anemia levels are above the unhcr standard (of <20% for children 6-59 months of age).
unhcr, wfp and arra are jointly implementing the ration cuts and have begun to work together on sensitising the refugee leaders and refugees in the camps of the changes in their entitlements."
"the latest economic outlook of the international monetary fund (imf) forecasts an improved external environment will support key exports and foreign direct investment and remittance inflows of ethiopia.
despite the 2020 outlook that was published in october 2020 projecting the country’s real gdp growth to be zero for 2021, improvements have been recorded which now stands at two percent.
“ethiopia’s growth forecast for 2021 remains unchanged at 2.0 percent, with growth in 2022 facing headwinds from the slow pace of vaccination, a possible pickup in covid-19 infections, and the tigray conflict,” it said.
meanwhile the forecast for 2022 did not give a numerical estimation on the latest report.
similarly a year ago, the imf had projected that the government debt shall stand at 58.5 percent of the gdp, however the latest report that was issued on thursday october 21 forecasts it will stand at 57.1 percent over one percent lower than the preceding projection. similar to gdp, imf did not forecast the 2022 projections owing to an unusually high degree of uncertainty.
for the 2021 ethiopia’s reserve was estimated to be 1.8 months of imports of goods and services. the reserve amount has declined from two months estimation for 2020. the country reserve amount was on its peak to 2.2 months in 2019 which in comparison was stated that it would be better to be at least three months similar to the global standard.
most of sub saharan african countries reserve has estimated to show reduction in the 2022.
on its outlook imf stated that sub-saharan africa is projected to grow by 3.7 percent in 2021 and 3.8 percent in 2022, “a welcome but relatively modest recovery, suggesting that divergence with the rest of the world will persist over the medium term.”
it said that the sub-saharan africa’s economy is set to recover in 2021 – a marked improvement over the extraordinary contraction of 2020. this rebound is most welcome and primarily results from a favorable external environment, including a sharp improvement in trade and commodity prices. in addition, improved harvests have lifted agricultural production, “yet, the outlook remains highly uncertain as the recovery depends on the progress in the fight against covid-19 and is vulnerable to disruptions in global activity and financial markets.”
“as sub-saharan africa navigates through a persistent pandemic with repeated waves of infection, a return to normal will be far from easy,” stressed abebe aemro selassie, director of the imf’s african department. in the absence of vaccines, lockdowns and other containment measures have been the only option for containing the virus.
at 3.7 percent this year, the recovery in sub-saharan africa will be the slowest in the world—as advanced markets grow by more than 5 percent, while other emerging markets and developing countries grow by more than 6 percent. this mismatch reflects sub-saharan africa’s slow vaccine rollout and stark differences in policy space."
"the ethiopian agency for civil society organizations which changed its name to ethiopian civil society organization authority has given back work permits for al maktoum foundation one of the three, non-government organizations (ngo) which have been previously banned due to unlawful acts. the authority is also completing its investigation on the other two organizations to give back their permit
also according to the information capital has obtained, the authority is investigating certain international organizations that are doing illegal acts which will be released in the coming days in order to take the necessary measures.
“activities of civil organizations should be based on their mission with respect to the country laws and sovereignty,” said jima debol director of the authority, indicating that some international organizations are still working illegal acts. “the authority will take various remedial measures, ranging from warnings to suspensions and closures of the civil society organizations that threaten ethiopia’s sovereignty, unity and security depending on the nature of the damage,” the director remarked. as he said the authority is investigating and various punitive measures which will be taken against some charities that are operating outside of the objectives they were established.
on august 4 2021, the agency suspended the license of three foreign non-government organizations (ngo) such as msf holland, the norwegian refugee council and al maktoum foundation. the reason behind the ban ranges from engaging in an unpermitted area of operation to disseminating misinformation.
the agency has identified rule violations by these organizations while monitoring their activities, msf holland and the norwegian refugee council have been disseminating misinformation in social media and other platforms outside of the mandate and purpose for which the organizations were permitted to operate. also, these organizations employed foreign nationals without the appropriate work permit from the ethiopian government for more than six months.
msf holland illegally imported satellite radio equipment and made use of it. since the equipment was not authorized by the relevant government authority, the employees were thus apprehended by the security forces for using the equipment for illegal purposes.
furthermore, al maktoum foundation failed to comply with the ministry of education’s covi d-19 protocol, its mismanagement of budget and problems with staff management.
despite repeated discussions with the executives of all the three organizations, they were unable to fix the situation.
the agency for civil society organizations stated that the activities of the organizations have been suspended for three months in accordance with article 77 (4) of proclamation no. 1113/2011 until a final decision is made.
in related news on friday october 22, 2021 the authority and its international partners together launched the ethiopian civil society organizations mapping study.
the study which is supported by the eu civil society fund (iii), civil society support programme phase 2 and the federal agency for civil society organizations has been ongoing for the past six months throughout the country perhaps because of the intensification of the war in tigray region and parts of amhara region’s deterioration of security in parts of the country it has been limiting the researchers.
the purpose of the research is said to provide updated multidimensional information on csos in ethiopia operating at national and regional levels.
in undertaking the study the experts interviewed 324 key informants from 262 institutions pertinent to the civil society sector.
there are three types of civil society organizations operating in ethiopia one national civil society organizations, one national civil society organizations which are registered at federal level, regional and sub-regional, the second one is international civil society organizations and the last one is cbos and other informal social groupings.
according to the study currently there are 3,244 civil society organizations, 2,732 local civil society organizations, 50 consortiums of civil society organizations and 462 international civil society organizations operating in ethiopia."
"terminating the african growth and opportunity act (agoa) will directly harm low-income employees especially women than the government says the federal industrial park development corporation /ipdc/ asking the us to consider its decision beyond politics. similarly, experts suggested that if the termination turns to become real it could increase unemployment and migration increasing pressure on the government.
following the conflict in the northern part of the country, the government of america has been saying ethiopia’s eligibility to the agoa for the year 2022 will be tabled for discussion if the conflicting parties come up to stop the conflict.
“however the termination could affect low employee ordinary ethiopians than having direct impact on the political situation,” said sandukan debebe ceo of ipdc. “terminating the platform is like forcing thousands of workers to lose their jobs”, sandukan said explaining ethiopia’s eligibility to agoa and its direct access to the us market to export the aforementioned items, where the industrial parks are specialized, have given the country immense competitive advantage to attract global actors in the industries to come and operate within the facilities developed.
as sandukan said there are parties who want to hurt the country as well as force and mislead the us government to make sanctions on ethiopia.
“removing ethiopia from agoa has a direct effect of putting all the employees hired by the companies supply products to the export market and ultimately undermining all the successes achieved over the years and also impede the development efforts of the poor,” said the ceo, adding, “we are working in providing information on the impact of the termination as it is against the goal of the act.”
since 2001 when agoa went into effect ethiopian eligibility to the agoa and its direct access to the us market without payment of duties and taxes has contributed significantly to the inflow of capitals into the country in the manufacturing sector mainly in the light manufacturing sectors like the textile and garment, leather and leather products manufacturing sectors that have the potential to easily supply products to the export market and absorb many employments.
“industrial parks are one of the examples which can show that we are using the platform as it is planned,” said sandukan. as a flagship project in the country hawassa industrial park, one of the biggest industrial parks in the country particularly has more than 35,000 workers, of which more than 80 percent of them are less educated women, having 23 companies. according to ipdc the huge exporting market of hawassa industrial park is us using agoa, “this could affect their income until they find other proportional markets,” said sandukan.
as experts believe, if the decision comes up to a termination it could increase unemployment and social crises as industrial parks have created huge employment opportunities for millions both directly and indirectly. as they said this could have negative pressure on the government, increasing unemployment and migration.
currently, there are 22 industrial parks of which 13 of them are owned and managed by the federal government, 4 integrated agro industrial parks managed by the regional government while 7 are private parks. from the stated 13 federal owned parks, 11 of them are operational. the federal government has, thus far, invested close to 1.5 billion dollar to 13 industrial parks to attract foreign direct investment and attain various macro-economic and social benefits.
from the total 24 industrial parks developed in the country, 22 are now in operation and the country has managed to attract more than 250 domestic and foreign investors which till august 2021 created employment opportunities for 86,837 unskilled laborers and more than twenty thousand posts for skilled labor and graduates, excluding the three industrial parks in tigray region which have ceased operations for the last one year.
all the 22 operational industrial parks now host more than 250 domestic and foreign investors. the two major drivers that attract foreign investors to locate their businesses in ethiopia are the country’s access to the us market through agoa and a competitive labor cost, learned from actors in the field.
according to the ipdc inclusive of the ones in the industrial park context, currently more than 65 textiles and apparel, and 67 major leather products, and gloves manufacturing industries employ over 200,000 direct jobs which 80 percent of them are women and youth and generate about 230 million dollars per annum.
the life of more than a million low-income citizens relies on textile and leather manufacturing industries, there are hundreds of thousands of farmers supplying cotton and rearing livestock and others involved in the value chain in the supply of various inputs for consumptions of respective industries and export of final products to the export market.
“both the manufacturing and the textile sectors are highly integrated with the local economy in different ways like catering, service, transportation service, housing, and greenery through auxiliary services provision schemes to the industrial parks,” explained sandukan.
ipdc have, thus far, generated export earnings amounting more than 750 million usd since 2014. currently out of the 33 direct exporters operating in industrial parks specialized on the textile and garment manufacturers in ethiopia, 30 enterprise export directly to the usa through the agoa.
as part of the efforts made to attract fdis to the country and following the massive inflow of international capital and operators in different business undertakings into ethiopia, mainly the ethiopian market entered subsequent to the country’s direct access to the us market, there have been several institutional changes, new departures in the policies and endeavors in establishing institutes for the development of various industrial sectors.
with regards to tariff benefits and general eligibility criteria, agoa is similar to the generalized system of preferences (gsp), a u.s. trade preference program that applies to more than 120 developing countries all over the world. agoa, however, covers more products and includes additional eligibility criteria beyond those in gsp. additionally, agoa includes trade and development provisions beyond its duty-free preferences. agoa builds on gsp by providing preferential access to the u.s. market for more products, such as apparel, and sets out additional eligibility criteria.
agoa every year through the president of the usa has the mandate to revise eligible countries which usually took place in september and october. since its enactment, the u.s government has amended agoa five times, making some technical changes and renewing the trade preferences. during the submission of the bill for renewal back in 2015, the u.s.a. government asserted that agoa has been the cornerstone of america’s economic engagement with sub-saharan africa over the past fourteen years.
eligibility for the agoa trade preference program consists of two separate steps. first, the country must be included in a registry list of sub-saharan african countries. the second step requires the president of the usa to determine annually which eligible countries, from those on the list, should become beneficiaries of the agoa preferences following annual reviews.
as it is prescribed under the agoa legislation, there are two different sets of criteria for the president’s consideration in this process; number of factors related to the potential agoa beneficiary country’s economy, rule of law, elimination of barriers to u.s. trade and investment, poverty reduction efforts, protection of worker rights, support of terrorist activities, and interference with u.s. national security and foreign policy efforts. eligibility requirements of the gsp must also be met by any agoa beneficiary country, including a number of economic and political factors."
"in a letter issued on 30 september 2021, the ministry of foreign affairs of ethiopia has declared a “persona non grata” for seven individuals who are working for un humanitarian agencies in ethiopia. as the letter explains, the decision was made as result of the individuals meddling in the internal affairs of the country.
the letter addressed each of the 7 individuals to leave the country with in the 72 hours which started from the late afternoon of thursday september 30.
the 7 individuals listed on the letter includes five members of the un humanitarian affairs office, ocha, including senior leaders, were being ordered out of the country, as well as the un children’s fund unicef representative, and a team leader from the un human rights office, ohchr, adele khodr, unicef representative in ethiopia, sonny onyegbula, monitoring, reporting and advocacy team leader : united nations office of high commissioner for human rights, kwesi sansculotte, peace and development advisor: unocha, saeed mohamoud hersi: deputy head of office: office for coordination of humanitarian affairs in ethiopia, grant leaity, deputy humanitarian coordinator: office for coordination of humanitarian affairs in ethiopia, ghada eltahir mudawi: acting deputy humanitarian coordinator: office for coordination of humanitarian affairs in ethiopia, marcy vigoda, head of office: office for coordination of humanitarian affairs in ethiopia.
a statement by the ministry of foreign affairs about its decision on un staffers released on friday evening reads “in connection to the current situation in the northern part of ethiopia, we had sadly observed that some un staff have failed to fulfill their mission independently and impartially in accordance with the abovementioned mou and the relevant principles of the un. these serious violations have been brought to the attention of the relevant un high officials and other international partners on multiple occasions, but to no avail. despite these communications of concern, the grave violations persisted. as such, as a measure of last resort, the government of ethiopia had to ask some officials of un agencies to leave the country.”
the statement further reads “therefore, in order to avoid confusion regarding the measure taken by the government, we wish to highlight some of the following breaches: which these individuals have committed in violation of their professional code of conduct: diversion of humanitarian assistance to the tplf; violating agreed-upon security arrangements; transferring communication equipment to be used by the tplf; continued reticence in demanding the return of more than 400 trucks commandeered by the tplf for military mobilization and for the transportation of its forces since july 2021; and dissemination of misinformation and politicization of humanitarian assistance. ethiopia is deeply disappointed by the fact that some countries are urging the united nations security council to consider this matter. this is a blatant violation of ethiopia’s sovereign prerogative on matters of national security. we are confident the security council will reject this undue politicization of humanitarian assistance.”
after the decision, united nations general secretary antonio guterres in a statement said “i was shocked by the decision of the government of ethiopia which has declared seven un officials, including senior un humanitarian officials, as persona non grata.”
“all un humanitarian operations are guided by the core principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence. in ethiopia, the un is delivering lifesaving aid including food, medicine, water, and sanitation supplies to people in desperate need. i have full confidence in the un staffs that are in ethiopia doing this work,” said the secretary.
“we strongly condemn ethiopia’s decision to expel seven un officials whose work is critical to humanitarian relief, the united states calls for this decision to be reversed and will not hesitate to respond decisively,” tweeted united states state secretary, antony blinken."
"the alliance for food sovereignty in africa (afsa) urged donors to stop funding the western led alliance for a green revolution in africa (agra). the move comes after agra failed to provide credible evidence to refute research done by afsa that challenges the 15-year-old industrial initiative adopted by the former.
as agra’s green revolution forum opens, members of the alliance are challenging donors to halt funding solutions that have not presented advantages to the continent, but rather focus on a healthy, sustainable and culturally appropriate food system for africa.
“we welcome investment in agriculture on our continent,” wrote afsa general coordinator million belay in a recent co-authored article in scientific american. “but we seek it in a form that is democratic and responsive to the people at the heart of agriculture” he added.
the alliance urged prominent organizations such as the bill and melinda gates foundation, the rockefeller foundation, the german, dutch and canadian governments and other donors to stop financing agra’s initiative which is believed to be driving the hunger crisis in africa.
in a press conference organized by afsa, general coordinator of afsa, million belay highlighted the vision. “we want to be able to produce healthy and nutritious food… we want the right to food,” he said, emphasizing the integral role the african continent and its people play in the system overall.
there is a growing opposition of western-centric ways of farming in africa in particular and in the global south in general due to its stressed value of agro-chemicals as well as artificial fertilizers and pesticides. the promotion of high-end varieties including gmos and others invite local african farmers to reorient their agriculture to unfamiliar mechanisms that seldom result in ecofriendly results.
speakers during the conferences also stressed the economic and social impacts such influence could present including potential health and cultural crisis. this is also believed to undermine the rights of farmers and their benefits. another issue raised was the lack of adequate support for sub-saharan african scientists to conduct their research and come up with local solutions for local problems.
an open letter initiated by 35 of afsa’s member networks along with five allied organizations was presented and garnered 160 international organizations."
"a research done by bill and melinda gates foundation reveals how the world stepped up to prevent worst-case scenarios from happening and the need for long-term investments to ensure an equitable recovery and continued progress toward the global goals.
the findings of the research were announced at the fifth annual goalkeepers report organized by the company. it features an updated global dataset illustrating the pandemic’s adverse impact on progress toward the united nations sustainable development goals (global goals).
according to the findings, those who have been hit the hardest due to the pandemic will likely be the slowest to recover from it. because of covid-19, an additional 31 million people were pushed into extreme poverty in 2020 compared to 2019. and while 90% of advanced economies will regain pre-pandemic per capita income levels by next year, only a third of low- and middle-income economies are expected to do so.
fortunately, the world stepped up to avert some of the worst-case scenarios. this is a contrast to last year’s predicted drop of 14 percentage points in global vaccine coverage effectively erasing 25 years of progress in 25 weeks. new analysis from ihme demonstrates that the decline, while still unacceptable, was only half of what was anticipated.
co-chairs of the research have highlighted the “breathtaking innovation” that was only possible due to global collaboration, commitment, and investments over decades. they acknowledge that averting the worst-case scenarios is commendable, yet they note it’s not enough.
another issue brought to light was the economic impact that the pandemic has had on women globally. in both high and low income countries, women were affected more than men.
“women face structural barriers in every corner of the world, leaving them more vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic,” said co-chair melinda gates. she also emphasized the need to invest in women now to address inequities as well as their responsibilities governments have to spur a more equitable recovery while strengthening their economies against future crises.
as vaccines continue to be administered to millions around the globe, the report illustrates how decades of investment, policies, and partnerships enabled the speed of vaccines to begin being rollouts. however, the systems that allowed for the unprecedented development and deployment of the covid-19 vaccine exist primarily in wealthy countries, and as a result, has not benefited all countries equally.
“the lack of equitable access to covid-19 vaccines is a public health tragedy,” said bill gates. he added that the world will face very real risks in the future if wealthy countries and communities begin to treat the pandemic as another disease of poverty. “we can’t put the pandemic behind us until everyone, regardless of where they live, has access to vaccines.”
more than 80% of all covid-19 vaccines have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries to date, with some securing two to three times the number needed so they can cover boosters. in low-income countries however, that number drops to less than 1%. africa, although is home to 17% of the world’s population, has less than 1% of the world’s vaccine manufacturing capabilities.
“we must invest in local partners to strengthen the capacity of researchers and manufacturers in lower income countries to create the vaccines and medicines they need,” said gates foundation ceo mark suzman. “the only way we will solve our greatest health challenges is by drawing on the innovation and talent of people all over the world.”"
"the state owned insurance company, ethiopian insurance corporation (eic) asset rises to 18 billion birr, while reaching an annual premium of over 6.1 billion birr. additional to its existing services, the company is waiting a green light from the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) to start the covid-19 clinical trial insurance policy.
as the ceo netsanet lemessa said, the company has submitted its interest to the national bank in january last budget year and is still waiting for the approval from the nbe. as netsanet said, nbe is working its assessment on the issue.
in its performance of the completed budget year, the company has registered 6.1 billion birr in premium revenue collection which is the highest tax revenue and 17.1 percent higher than the target. the amount of premiums registered during the fiscal year was 23.5 percent or 1.2 billion birr more than the previous fiscal year.
of the total premiums registered, 5.9 billion birr or 96.5 percent of the total insurance was registered, while the remaining 216 million birr or 3.5 percent was registered in the long-term life insurance sector, according to the ceo. netsanet said that the company has collected 44 percent of the premium in the insurance industry in the current fiscal year. he also explained that the annual plan was 89 percent, an increase of 52 percent compared to the same period last year.
the company has also secured 3.2 trillion birr from contract sales during the fiscal year, down 8.6 percent from the same period last year. the ceo attributed the reduction to the reduction in the number of passengers due to the cv-19 in the aviation security sector. in the fiscal year, it reported a total of 162,890 contracts for sales and renewals, which is 1 percent higher than the same period last year. the target was 98.7 percent of the target.
the company has also paid 1.3 billion birr in compensation during the fiscal year. this is an increase of 81 percent from the plan and 18 percent compared to the same period last year. the total insurance share is 1.2 billion birr or 93.8 percent, while the long-term insurance sector accounts for 79 million birr or 62 percent.
regarding the company’s expenditure during the fiscal year, the compensation rate is 47 percent, which is lower than the plan and the industry’s compensation rate. one of the reasons why the company was able to make a huge profit of 1.12 billion birr during the fiscal year is that the compensation was low.
according to the company’s annual report, 1.4 billion birr worth of contracts were registered in the fiscal year. the total insurance sector has 1.39 billion birr and the long-term insurance sector has 13.2 million birr, which are 32.7 percent higher than the target and 54.7 percent higher than the previous fiscal year.
despite the company’s successful performance during the fiscal year, it has not been able to achieve the desired results and move in certain areas. ethiopia’s social, economic and political instability and ongoing conflict in the tigray region are the major issues identified in the industry. as the ceo explained branches in the region have operated less than 40 percent of the plan.
beside the covid 19 epidemic, the rising cost of spare parts and maintenance costs along with foreign exchange rates are other challenges that are pushing the company to spend more than planned.
other problems identified during the fiscal year include poor performance in construction project due to various challenges, delayed procurement and implementation of consulting services, and high competition in the cost-effective industry.
“despite the problems identified during the fiscal year, the company’s performance is impressive,” said the ceo.
“as part of the life insurance, the company is preparing to do the same for the policy that covers all clinical trials by widening the scope,” said the ceo.
eic shares are about 50 percent of the overall insurance market share in addition to the other 18 insurance companies in the country."
"outflow negates total disbursementsthe state owned enterprises (soes) external debt contracts for the second consecutive year following the government firmness on non-concessional loans. for the 2020/21 fiscal year, the net external debt resource flows were recorded as negative. compared to the preceding five years, the total amount of disbursement from external sources was much lower.
the past fiscal year, public sector debt statistical bulletin that was published by debt management directorate, ministry of finance (mof) indicated that the external debt stock for soes that include enterprises, which access finance without government guarantee has dropped to usd 10.05 billion in the year. it has also reduced in terms of the share of the total outstanding debt that includes domestic debts by 1.6 percentage compared with the preceding year.
the mof data for the year that ended on june 30 indicated that the soes outstanding external loan has stood at usd 10.05 billion that was usd 10.86 billion in june 2020 and usd 11.1 billion in june 2019.
similarly, from the total outstanding debt the soes debt stock has reduced to 18.06 percent that was 19.6 percent and 20.6 percent in the past two years respectively.
of the total external debt the central government owes 66 percent, while soes with and without government guarantees owe the remaining 34 percent.
the mof annual bulletin stated that the entire external public debt disbursement over the last twelve months (july 1, 2020 – june 30, 2021) was usd 1.4 billion, with around 72 percent of it going to central government projects from various creditors, “the majority of which came from ida. when compared to the preceding five years, the total amount of disbursement from external sources was much lower.”
during the last year’s new external loan agreements signed by central government with ida/the world bank, government of italy and dansk sk. bank amounted to usd 1.4 billion, and as per the non-concessional borrowing limit there was no non-concessional borrowing except ethiopian airlines, which signed agreements with its commercial creditors, amounted to usd 363.41 million.
total external public sector debt service (principal plus interest and charges) during the last twelve months was usd 1.84 billion of which usd 474 million is interest. out the total public sector external debt service usd 1.54 billion was made by soes.
“the net external debt resource flows are negative over the period, i.e. in 2020/21, implying that the quantity of disbursement from external sources (inflow) is less than the total external debt service payments to creditors (outflow). this is due to lesser external disbursement over the period compared to the previous four years,” mof explained. the inflow was usd 1.4 billion.
as of june 30, 2021, the total nominal public sector debt (external and domestic) in percent of gdp was about 51 percent, nominal external debt in percent of gdp was around 27 percent, present value of external debt in percent of gdp was around 19 percent, and nominal domestic debt in percent of gdp was around 24 percent.
the total public sector debt stock including domestic as of june 30, 2021, was usd 55.6 billion, compared to usd 55.3 billion as of june 30, 2020. “total public debt in usd shows a minimal change: due to a decrease in domestic debt in usd due to a comparatively higher rate of depreciation of birr against usd in 2020/21, while in terms of birr the total domestic debt has increased by 221,506 billion birr.
in terms of share external debt makes up around 53 percent of overall government debt, with domestic debt accounting for the remaining 47 percent.
the central government owes usd 33.2 billion or 60 percent of the total public sector debt outstanding for both external plus domestic, while soes owe usd 22.4 billion. over the last year, the central government’s portion of total public debt stock has climbed by 9 percent, while soes’ share has declined by 10 percent, “this can be explained in part by soe’s zero non-concessional borrowing limit from external creditors, as well as soe’s lower borrowing from domestic sources and less disbursement from already committed old soe external loans.”
the total public sector external debt was usd 29.5 billion as of june 30, 2021, compared to usd 29 billion of last year, “the increment in external total public debt is about usd 643 million, or about 2 percent over last year’s stock; the majority of this increment in the stock of debt can be explained by usd exchange rate variation which is about usd 601 million, a relatively higher depreciation of the us dollar, particularly as compared to the sdr and euro.”
“because ethiopia is a g20 dssi eligible country that has signed a memorandum of understanding with the paris club secretariat on dssi related to paris club countries and non-paris club countries, we are currently not making any external debt service payments for our bilateral creditors of central governments as per the g20 dssi,” the mof bulletin explained and to do that during the period of may 1 ,2020 – june 30 ,2021 as an eligible country of dssi initiative, has suspended the external debt service payment of central government to its bilateral creditors amounted to usd 220.0 million."
"ethio vehicles importer owners association claims that the outgoing parliament should respond to their claim which they filed over a year ago.
the association leaders expressed concern by stating that if their case was to be transferred to the newly elected parliament, it will be challenging to solve.
when parliament amends the highly discussed excise tax proclamation, which significantly revised the former law, in mid february 2020, the government had given a green light for those, who had secured a bank permit prior to the ratification of the proclamation no. 1186/2020 to import their used cars in six months time with the previous excise rate.
however, importers have claimed that the global pandemic, covid 19, has created challenges in concluding the process under the given period that ended mid august 2020.
“following the outbreak of covid 19 countries have closed their borders, movement of people have been halted and event vessels were stuck on different ports due to that we can not manage transporting the vehicles as per the deadline,” mohamed amede, president of the association explained.he said that due to that the association had discussed the issue with the ministry of finance senior officials and reached on common understanding to see a way to solve the problem, while the case was to be solved by the parliament, which is responsible for the law it amended. the association disclosed that it has followed the required path to file its case for revenue, budget and finance standing committee of the parliament and discussed with members of the committee.
“despite our communications with the standing committee, our issue is not yet solved for the past over a year,” the president complained.
he said that due to the delay of decision from the relevant body, importers are facing unnecessary costs including capital freeze, assets foreclosure for the collateral they borrowed from banks and demurrage at djibouti and customs warehouse in ethiopia.
so far 637 vehicles including 308 in djibouti are stranded for several months because of the stated issue.
importers argued that following coronavirus occurrence, the government has taken massive measures including easing some rules and regulation to mitigate the challenge that faces on the socioeconomic sphere, “however when it comes to our case we did not get any similar support that others secured, which is a double standard and unfair,” they said on the press conference held on september 2.
“now we plead the parliament to solve our issue before it leaves for the newly elected parliament,” they said.
vehicles which are stranded at the port and warehouse with an estimation of over 318 million birr were imported by 86 importers.
the new parliament will be inaugurated in the first week of october.
the association has 1,500 members, while licensed importers from federal transport authority are over 3,000.
the amended excise that became effective as of february 2020 has imposed huge levy on used cars."

"ministry of agriculture has completed its preparation to float an international bid for the procurement of different kinds of fertilizer for the coming year’s harvest.
oumer hussein, minister of agriculture, told capital that the ministry has completed preparing its document to float the bid for the procurement of 20 million quintals of fertilizers for next year to ensure farmers get it on time. as he said the bid is expected to be floated in the coming one month.
as oumer stated, the ministry is working to create more effective supply chains for the farmer, where farmers’ productivity has been going down because fertilizer and other agricultural inputs are not being distributed on time. in some places even after the “belg” seasons begins without farmers having what they need to plant.
ethiopia mainly used dap and urea fertilizers which solely gives nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients.
according to the world bank, over 70 percent of the households reported that fertilizer is often supplied late and around 40 percent of the households reported that supplies were inadequate. high prices and tight credit repayment schedules constrain fertilizer use.
transportation cost is another major contributor to the high cost of fertilizers, there is seasonal variation of demand and there is lack of information and communication among stakeholders in the fertilizer supply chain.
according to food and agriculture organizations /fao/, fertilizer consumption of ethiopia increased from 0.4 kilograms per hectare in 1969 to 36.2 kilograms per hectare in 2018 growing at an average annual rate of 16.25%. as oumer said last year the ministry had purchased 18 million quintals of fertilizer, and as he indicates the number is showing a 20-25 percent increase from year to year which is ‘great development’.
in the current farming season, shortage of urea fertilizer and improved seeds has been a challenge in some areas. as oumer said, efforts made by the ministry have minimized the effects.
talking about the current harvest season, oumer indicated the farming is well on-going as in most parts of the country farming is in smooth flow, which is about 91 percent of the target land.
beside instability in some parts, and late rainy season were some additional challenges to the farming.
in deploying parts of the country which didn’t start their farming, the ministry has prepared certain coping mechanisms including the use of the coming ‘belg’ season.
it is to be recalled that few months ago the ministry had procured two ships of 50,000 tones fertilizers which has arrived at the port of djibouti which was transported to ethiopia for distribution.
according to the wfp and fao, ethiopia agriculture cluster report, the current response to support the vulnerable farming communities with adequate agricultural inputs remained below the expected target for most regions due to low funding, delayed procurement and logistical challenges during this period. in total 12.9 million people (24% of the analysed population of about 54 million) are expected to face high levels of acute food insecurity."

compared to its pre-covid-19 performance, marked as june 2019, global demand for air cargo services were up 9.9%, bumping first half-year growth to 8%.
“air cargo is doing brisk business as the global economy continues its recovery from covid-19 crisis,” said willie walsh, iata director general. “air cargo is a revenue lifeline for many airlines as they struggle with border closures that continue to devastate the international passenger business. importantly, the strong first-half performance looks set to continue.”
despite improvements, overall capacity suffered, down 10.8% compared to pre-covid-19 levels. belly capacity also decreased by 38.9%, impacted partially by a 29.7% increase in dedicated freighter capacity.
economic conditions are supply chain dynamics remain favorable for the air cargo industry. low inventory to sales ratios in the united states means businesses rely on air cargo to quickly refill their stocks. cost-competitiveness and reliability of air cargo has also improved, and prices relative to shipping have decreased significantly.
regional variations in performance are significant. african airlines had the strongest performance of all regions, with a demand increase of 33.5%, but on small volumes, carrying only 2% of global cargo. north american carriers reported a 23.4% increase in international demand, and european carriers reported 6.6%. middle eastern airlines posted a 17.1% rise in international cargo volumes in june 2021 compared to june 2019, while latin american carriers had a decline of 22.9%."

"the ethiopian human rights commission (ehrc) is investigating the reports related with child soldiers which are being deployed by the tplf group in the war front after receiving reports.
beside its attack on civilians living in the neighboring region, the tplf is deploying children to the battle front, as reports shows.;w multiple pictures going viral among ethiopians in social media indicates that the tigray people’s liberation front is extensively using child soldiers in the battle against the ethiopian defense force and amhara region forces.
earlier this week, the tplf launched an extensive military campaign in the afar region, although, the tplf was unable to prevail in the afar region and continue a military offensive. it has suffered a crushing defeat in alele sulula area of the afar region. a force called may day has been deployed according to government report deploying child soldiers in the front as well. however, the tplf forces were defeated, and several child soldiers were captured.
“the tplf is forcing children to get in the war by giving them about three days of trainings, and is also collecting bodies of the children killed in the fights to spread its propaganda,” says the national defense force.
also the government expressed that the leaders of the tplf group are ordering not to give aids for families that didn’t sent their children to the fight.
expertise working on the human rights says that role of children taking direct part in war bears serious implications for their physical and emotional well-being. they are commonly subject to abuse and most of them witness death, killing, and sexual violence. many are forced to commit violent acts and some suffer serious long-term psychological consequences. the reintegration of these children into civilian life is an essential part of the work to help child soldiers rebuild their lives and is often a long road to fully recovery
in ethiopia the minimum age for military service is 18 and although such service was not compulsory, there had been “credible” reports that lots of teenagers had been forcibly recruited into the army, especially during preparations for the offensive. also recruiting and using children under the age of 15 as soldiers is prohibited under international humanitarian law, treaty and custom, and is defined as a war crime by the international criminal court.
although the international community has been calling for an end to the conflict and resorting to political dialogue to resolve the dispute between the federal government and tplf, they are however quiet about tplf using child soldiers in battles, government blamed. prime minister abiy ahmed also accused the international community of the silence about the tplf recruitment of child soldiers.
aron masho, public relation director at ehrc told capital that, the commission is investigating the situation based on reports the commission has received. “since the commission follows up human rights violation, we are working to find out what the situation is,” said aron, adding that so far there is no completed report."
"despite economic challenges associated with the covid-19 pandemic, many east african countries are projected to see positive growth during the recovery process this coming year, according to smollan.
east african nations are in better condition going into the recovery process, as most have a diversified economy and non-reliance on exports of commodities, according to analyst judd murigi from icea lion asset management.
“how governments and the private sector respond to the impact of the pandemic over the coming months will determine the mid- and long-term success of the region’s efforts at building back better,” said hardeep sound, sap, east africa.
according to a deloitte east africa economic impact report, countries such as kenya and ethiopia which had slower gdp growth last year will see positive growth rates this year. east africa is one of the fastest growing regions on the continent, and has more potential for acceleration.
ethiopia specifically has promising growth potential, being the second most populous nation in africa. one obstacle other than its closed economy is the unreliability of supply chains in a landlocked country with relatively poor infrastructure. additionally, many consumer goods are imported, and the birr is weakening, making inflation a significant concern.
other countries within east africa are experiencing similar effects. kenya, according to fanuzi, is on the verge of moving from a low-income nation to a middle-class consumer economy. in uganda, many business owners and retail supply chains were disrupted, impacting the majority of the population that relies on daily wages. rwanda, after implementing one of the strictest lockdown policies in the continent, is expected to grow by 5.1%.
during the pandemic, much like other nations, east african countries experienced a positive impact on online retailers, brick and mortar markets being severely impacted, increased demand for cleaning products and food supplies, and rising unemployment."
"yonsei global health center (yghc), with funding and support from the korea international cooperation agency (koica), will run a project called the small, happy and prosperous family in ethiopia (shape) project until december 2023.
the shape project, also called the national campaign for promoting knowledge, attitude, and behavioral changes in population and reproductive health in ethiopia, aims to improve awareness of sexual reproductive health and gender equality in ethiopia and contribute to decreasing the fertility and maternal mortality rate.
the project has funding of usd 1.7 million, and will run in addis, amhara, dire dawa, oromia, sidama, somali, tigray and southern nations, nationalities, and peoples’ region (snnpr).
according to worldometers, the ethiopian population has already surpassed 117 million people. more than 34.6 million people, or 29.6% of the population, are living below the poverty line and earning less than usd 1.25 per day.
ethiopia also has some of the lowest gender equality performance indicators in sub-saharan africa. women and girls are disadvantaged in literacy, health, livelihoods, and basic human rights, among other areas. they suffer low status in society and lack social support networks.
women’s health is also poor, affected by poverty, poor nutrition, and restricted access to health care services due to financial constraints and cultural beliefs, according to the 2011 and 2016 ethiopian demographic and health survey (edhs). that same survey found that more than 95% of respondents did not know where to go for contraceptive services and/or they had poor knowledge of or exposure to modern contraceptive methods.
maternity can also be dangerous for both mother and child in ethiopia, which was exacerbated by the pandemic. covid-19 reduced the amount of clients presenting for family planning by 27%. skilled deliveries decreased by 27.6% and postpartum family planning by 66.7%."
"covid-19 cases in africa have skyrocketed, with a recorded 43% week-on-week rise in deaths according to the world health organization (who).
the surge in cases is a result of frustration and fatigue with key health measures, according to the who. it’s also possible the three covid-19 variants, delta, alpha, and beta, are responsible. the delta variant, the most transmissible strain so far, has been detected in 21 african nations, the alpha variant in 35 and beta in 30.
“this is a clear warning sign that hospitals in the most impacted countries are reaching a breaking point,” said matshidiso moeti, who regional director for africa. “effective treatment is the last line of defense against covid-19 and it must not crumble.”
the recent surge is the fastest the continent has seen during the entire pandemic. over the past month, africa has recorded 1 million new cases, and is now only 1% away from the weekly fatality peak from january 2021. 6,273 deaths were recorded last week, 83% of them from namibia, south africa, tunisia, uganda, and zambia. currently, an average of 2.6% of covid-19 cases in africa become fatal compared to a global average of 2.2%.
hospitals are suffering extreme oxygen shortages due to disrepair or poor maintenance of production plants, as well as distribution challenges, personnel or technical skills. at least six african nations are experiencing a bed shortage in intensive care. medical oxygen demand has spiked, hitting 50% higher than at the same time last year, while only 27% of the needed supply is produced.
additionally, only 18 african nations have confirmed that they are including corticosteroids, a medication recommended by the who, in their national treatment guidelines. nine countries are using non-recommended treatments, including hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir.
“the number one priority for african countries is boosting oxygen production to give critically ill patients a fighting chance,” moeti said. “under-resourced health systems in countries are facing dire shortages of the health workers, supplies, equipment and infrastructure needed to provide care to severely ill covid-19 patients.”
vaccinations in africa are also at levels deemed inadequate by the who. africa accounts for only 1.6% of the 3.5 billion people vaccinated worldwide, despite being around 17.21% of the world’s population. only 18 million africans, or 1.5% of the continent’s population, are vaccinated. around 190 million doses are needed to raise the percentage up to 10% by september 2021. 750 million doses are needed to raise it to 30% by the end of the year.
“the double barrier of vaccine scarcity and treatment challenges is seriously undermining effective response to the surging pandemic,” moeti added.
the who is providing guidance on clinical management and support in updating procedure and training health workers in order to improve covid-19 treatment. it will also work with partners to deliver medical supplies, including oxygen cylinders, and supporting the manufacture and repair of oxygen production plants."

“the party was established by the committee formed by the people of the raya to fight for the independence of raya,” said eyasu berhe, one of the members of the central committee of the party. as he said, the committee has submitted its petition to the house of federation and is expecting to hold a referendum.
raya rayuma party asked the government to accept the petition submitted to the house of federation to become a state. the party argues making raya an independent region that could play a big role.
the party also accuses the tplf and the amhara special forces, “the atrocities at raya these days are immense,” said eyasu adding, “former, dictator leaders made raya stateless and an unidentified ethnic group.”
as he explains, during the war, atrocities were committed on the raya people had been and are suppressed by the amhara special forces and after the unilateral ceasefire declared around two weeks ago, the territory has been classified in to two in which towns of both sides are controlled by the tplf and the amhara special force.
“it is high time that the government should protect the people, following the recent withdrawal of our defense forces from raya azebo, the tplf is causing serious humanitarian and economic hardship to our people. to describe some of the crimes committed,” eyasu points out.
on the other hand, the amhara regional state security forces, which entered raya woredas under the command of the tplf, have been patrolling alamata town’s shops, malls and boutiques from 23/10/2013 e.c to date. if this illegal activity continues, the issue of the rule of law will be set aside and there will be more serious human rights violations among the people of raya and the concern will not be ignored.
“we urge the federal government to save our people from destruction, given that the people of raya are being attacked in a way that is worse than ever. in this regard, we would like to express our sincere appreciation to radepa and its members for their support to the government and our defense forces. to return to the town of mahoni and raya azebo woreda, where our defense forces left, to trust the government and fulfill its responsibility to protect the people who are on the side of the defense has led us to a dilemma,” said the committee member.
it is clear that the federal forces should enter raya chercher woreda and alamata town to stabilize the situation. in addition, the government should arm the raya to protect the area in order to protect the terrorists and militia.
while reacting to queries raised by parliamentarians, prime minister abiy ahmed on monday july 5 explained about the backdrop of the law enforcement measured took place in tigray region.
the premier said that the terrorist tplf mobilized the people of tigray for war despite the numerous livelihood challenges of the people and attacked the northern command of the national defense force and these threats pulled the federal government into a conflict.
“the federal government have had no aspirations to engage in conflict yet tplf posed a threat on four fronts,” abiy told parliament.
“tplf mobilized irregular forces siphoning national institutions and resources and mobilizing paid elements across the country given the mission to destabilize and multiply instability. sacrifices being made in the tigray region to restore services and repair basic infrastructure have cost us the lives of personnel in the line of duty as the criminal clique attacked these individuals,” adds the pm.
the premier underlined that gains have been made in addressing the tplf threat as the federal government has taken back weaponry seized illegally from the northern command, decreased the effects of the attempts to divide the ethiopian society and apprehended key leadership of the criminal clique.
“in my view, those interested in seeing the conclusion of the conflict in the tigray region are very few. it seems there are interests that seek to see the weakening of the ethiopian state through a protracted conflict” he added.
“as a sovereign nation, we have tolerated a lot. without government recognition armed forces were being organized, conflict entrepreneurs and propagandists were deployed throughout the country. the people of tigray were told that they were at risk of war. elders, investors, politicians, locals and investors were sent to mediate. ultimately, the northern command was attacked. we were forced to set out to defend the country and return looted national resources and weapons.”
in a related development the emergency fact check announced that the terrorist tplf is perpetrating continuous attacks against civilians in several towns of tigray.
“the terrorist group is killing civilians whom it profiled as supporters of the interim administration of tigray federal government,” the national emergency fact check platform states.
“continuous atrocities by the terrorist group are aid operations posing risk of serious humanitarian crisis in the region,” emergency fact check says."
"by maya demissieswarms of desert locusts have arrived in north east ethiopia, according to a report by the food and agriculture organization (fao) on thursday, july 8, 2021.
immature swarms of desert locusts have migrated from somalia to areas in southern djibouti and eastern ethiopia. more infestations are expected to appear in afar along the eastern ridge of the amhara highlands, and additional swarms have been spotted in the area near ayasha. some swarms may also arrive from yemen.
the locusts have been labeled a serious threat. the fao recommends that field operations be scaled up in northeast ethiopia and other affected regions. “intensive aerial control operations” will continue against these swarms in somalia.
while migration has been limited, more swarms are expected to arrive this month to breed. breeding levels will depend on the scale of migration, as well as the rainfall in the following months, which is projected to be higher than usual.
so far, infestations have been contained to the horn of africa. iran, pakistan, and india will be under watch during the summer."
"by maya demissiethe 2020 africa regional overview of food security and nutrition reported increasing levels of food insecurity, in part due to the covid-19 pandemic.
the report was compiled by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, the african union, and the united nations economic commission for africa, and argues that food insecurity in the continent is worsening. it outlines a five-step plan towards “rapid and effective transformation of food systems.”
“a common vision, strong political leadership, and effective cross-sectoral collaboration, including the private sector, are essential to agree on trade-offs and identify and implement sustainable solutions to transform food systems for healthy, affordable diets,” according to the report.
in 2019, the number of chronically undernourished people in africa rose to nearly one-fifth of the population, with numbers continuing to rise today. the number of people affected by severe food insecurity is also increasing, hitting 73 million people in 2019, an increase of 6 million from the year before. 426 million people are moderately food insecure.
nearly three quarters of africans cannot afford a healthy diet, 51 percent cannot afford a nutrient-adequate diet, and 11.3 percent cannot afford an energy sufficient diet. an energy sufficient diet would cost about 50 percent of food expenditure budgets for the 430 million africans living in extreme poverty.
covid-19 regulations worsened the availability and accessibility of food in africa. africa depends on extra-regional food imports of basic products, such as cereals, vegetable oils, sugar, meat and dairy products. this dependence exposed the continent to the economic shocks of covid-19. travel bans affected aircrafts and railroads, limiting food movement and decreasing trade. world trade volumes were expected to fall by 13 to 32 percent in 2020.
economic downturn and the consequential increased poverty rates in africa account for a portion of the increased food insecurity this past year, the report argues. real gdp in the continent fell by 2.1 percent in 2020. tourism-dependent countries were hit harder, with an average gdp decrease of 11.5 percent.
the economic damage is expected to push 26 to 40 million people into extreme poverty. additionally, unemployment is on the rise as labor jobs were sent home to quarantine. as more people fall into poverty or lose their jobs, they can no longer pay for sufficient food or a diverse diet, according to the report. in africa, an additional 25 to 42 million people may be undernourished as a result of the economic shocks from covid-19 pandemic, according to preliminary estimates.
the five-step plan includes performing comprehensive situation analysis, identifying cost drivers of healthy diets, addressing urgent needs of the most vulnerable, identifying policies and investments to leverage food systems transformation, and implementing policy recommendations and monitoring their impact.
social protection could mitigate food insecurity, the report argues. while the impact on nutrition is weaker, social programs can help to increase overall food consumption and dietary diversity. according to the report, 26 african countries had introduced a social protection program in some form by mid-2020. liberia, nigeria, and cape verde, among other countries, have introduced delivery or pick-up school lunch initiatives while students learn from home. taxes and subsidies can also be utilized to make food accessible to those living in poverty.
the report also emphasizes the threat of of maternal and child under nutrition, the leading factor in nutrition-caused diseases in africa. in kenya, a program ensured free maternity services for expecting mothers as part of the national nutrition action plan (nnap), encouraging mothers to deliver their babies in a health facility. during the program, the number of babies born in a health facility increased from 43 to 61 percent. in ghana, the baby-friendly hospital initiative helped focus on care and counseling for pregnant mothers and feeding and care practices for infants and young children.
focus on nutritional education is also suggested within the report. it is recommended that education includes both information on the importance of dietary diversity and specific ways to maintain a healthy diet with a tight budget."
"the office of the federal auditor general (ofag) has come up with another finding on mismanagement of public resources at public offices.
the finding on the 2019/20 budget year that ofag presented in parliament early this week shows that there are several irregularities related with administering public resources.
accrued tax and duty that supposed to be collected by branch offices of ministry of revenue and customs commission has found on the audit investigation. it stated that the amount that is not connected is over 7.7 billion birr.
it added that 390 million birr revenue from different tax sources is not amassed as per the requirement given by law for the tax collection authority.
ofag also identified that there are areas that customs commission to improve on contraband administration and establishment of well organized information data base on the operation to control the illegal business.
in related with the law enforcement measure on contrabandists there is also gaps that should be correct.
according to the audit finding, 7.5 billion birr is not accounted for from 90 public offices and 11 branches in the stated budget year. national disaster risk management commission, ministry of health and ministry of innovation and technology stood at the top this gap.
on its finding ofag underlined that 60 public offices and nine branches have conducted procurement worth 1.2 billion birr that is against the procedure stated on the procurement proclamation. of the stated amount over 753 million birr is aligned with ministry of technology and innovation, and the 254.8 million birr is connected with public procurement property disposal service.
62 offices and 11 branches have settled close to 97 million birr payments against regulation and directives. it has also shown that about 29 million birr has been paid without evidence.
on its 61 page report ofag has mentioned several audit gaps including those related with performance audit.
meseret damtew, deputy auditor general of ofag, said that there is a tendency of some public offices and enterprises resisting to be audited thus parliament should correct it.
at the session members of parliament expressed their anger on the gaps that are seen at public offices for several years. one of the representative said that relevant government officials should appear and provide explanation for the gaps that are identified on the audit.
the deputy auditor insists correction measures must be taken on responsible bodies who are involved on the irregularities."
"the development bank of ethiopia (dbe) has taken over the management of the turkish-owned etur textile limited, which has been unable to repay its loan which is over one billion birr. according to the development bank of ethiopia, it has taken over the management of the textile factory in adama, which is registered as a loan company due to its inability to repay the loan. the development bank has also appointed former managers of the textile factory as the company’s general manager, finance manager, marketing and other officials for management positions.
etur textile, founded in turkey in the 1950s and a world-renowned supplier of textile products, entered ethiopia in 2002. at the time, it was one of the turkish-textile factories that borrowed billions of birr from the development bank of ethiopia.
the factory, which was set up in adama, mainly produces elbows and has been providing inputs to various local companies that use elbows.
however, like other turkish companies, it has not been able to repay its loan on time. for the past six years, the factory has not been able to repay the loan of the development bank, and it has been on record of bad loans.
the bank has repeatedly written letters to the company to repay the loan, but the textile company failed to do so.
according to sources, the factory loan will exceed 1.2 billion birr with interest. although the development bank had repeatedly sought to sell the factory and return the money, the company did not comply with the auction due to the fact that the factory and the machines it imported were too small for the high cost of the loan.
two turkish companies, alsi addis and aika addis, have failed to repay billions of birr in loans from the development bank of ethiopia. it is well known that loans to turkish companies, in particular, have been criticized for exaggerating the loans made by the factory and the imported machine."
"the opening up of addis ababa exhibition centre and millennium hall is recommended as soon as possible to return back the mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) industry.
a study commissioned by the addis ababa chamber of commerce and sectoral association ‘on the impact of covid 19 in the networking and event organizing industry’ shows that the mice industry, which is a segment of the tourism industry that has been getting recognition as a sub-sector relevant for the development of tourism, has been significantly hampered by the global pandemic rather than any economic sector.
the study conducted by topclass consult indicated that like other countries, the pandemic in ethiopia affected every industry, and the mice industry is among those that was hit hard. “under the conditions of harsh travel restrictions and closed borders, the ethiopian mice industry faced a sharp reduction of demand,” the study revealed.
it added that ethiopian airlines, hotels, car rental companies and other tourism-related businesses have experienced significant losses.
because of the travel restrictions effected across the globe and public gathering restrictions imposed in the case of ethiopia, many events were canceled and millions in revenue were lost that led to more than 50 percent decrease in revenue compared to pre-covid 19 activities that also hampered the industry with cash shortage to settle their liabilities and invoices.
the study stated that networking and event organizing companies had adopted strategies to mitigate the challenge, while the government provided support through tax exemptions.
“the hit is so hard to the mice industry and with travel and public gathering restrictions are yet to be relax, the covid 19 impacts are so substantial and difficult to overcome in short period of time,” the report added.
it recommended that different initiatives are supposed to be applied to bring back the sector to normalcy.
“addis ababa exhibition center and operationalize of the millennium hall should resume their operation as soon as possible,” the report added.
kedir mussa, one of the presenters of the findings of the study, told capital that the two facilities are the major centers for events in the city but they were inactive for over a year because they are assigned to help fight the pandemic as one being a treatment center and the other used for mobilizing resources.
“the virus will not stop in the foreseeable future and due to that the government should shift the current activities to health centers and return the mice facilities back to their normal service on the aim to boost the economic benefit from the industry,” he explained.
he added that it is difficult to put value estimation in relation with the effect of covid 19 because of lack of access to the required data.
according to the study, the networking and event organizing companies are very concerned of the covid 19 outbreak and its impact on their business, since travel restrictions made most of the in person meetings cancelled.
companies in the mice industry are also highly impacted and are struggling financially or forced to completely close their business.
companies with strong financial source, such as the great ethiopia run, are impacted financially but are able to endure the storm.
the study also revealed that the outbreak of covid 19 in march 2020 followed by the lock down announcement by the government forced the mice industry to cancel 5 to 20 booked events on average which led to decrease in sales and loss of more than 5 million birr of revenue.
as a result of covid-19, the networking and event organizing companies have experienced 50 percent decrease in revenue for 2020 compared to 2019. they also faced 50 percent to 75 percent decrease in profits in 2020 and few even incurred loss, according to the study.
the study indicated that international arrivals, which may have different forms like leisure and holiday, business or conference in ethiopia have been growing steadily with little ups and downs over the past four prior-covid years.
as of march 2020, international arrivals decreased by 35.5 percent year-on-year to 118,950 mainly due to decreased or cancelled flights that follow the outbreak of covid 19.
in 2019 the tourism sector contributed 9 percent for gdp, while 812,000 tourists visited ethiopia and provided 2.2 million jobs, or 8.3 percent total employment.
before the pandemic hit, the ministry of tourism and culture expected this to increase even further and predicted it to be 2.5 million arrivals per year by 2020.
the mice industry is highly reliant and contributes to the leisure and hospitality sectors.
in its recommendation the study applaud the opening up of the networking and event organizing sector with companies to use prevention methods of the spread of covid 19, “trade fairs and exhibitions should strictly follow the covid19 preventive protocol.”"
"the national electoral board of ethiopia (nebe) takes administrative measures against the employees responsible for the error in the ballot papers, 27 constituencies are excluded from the june 21, 2021 election as result of error in the ballot papers.
the 6th general election will be held on june 21, 2021 in accordance with the new schedule the election board announced two weeks ago. the election which is expected to be held in less than a week beside various insecurity and logistic distresses, error in the ballot papers threatened the twice delayed national polls.
according to the national board announcement on thursday, it is to be recalled that the board stated that there are problems with the 54 constituencies that were found to be in need of re-printing of ballot papers. among these constituencies, the number of polling stations that have problems with voting is now 27. accordingly, voting in these 27 state and house of representatives constituencies will be held on september 6, 2021.
the board mentioned that some of the errors were human made and done intentionally and some happened in the process work related errors.
“the board has taken administrative measures on its employees which is up to prohibition from work in order to better determine who is responsible for the error in the ballot papers by mishandling data due to their neglect, ” said birtukan mideksa, chairwoman of the board on a press briefing given on thursday, june 10, 2021. the board will conduct a vetting process on the ballot paper and will announce the results explained birtukan. currently, the number of employees the board has taken the measures on is still undefined.
the new delay was needed because of logistical woes related to tasks like training electoral staff and printing and distributing ballot papers. the logistical challenges promise to be daunting even with the delay. likewise, staff shortages have been hindering the election. places where voter registration has not started, due to security concerns, locations where voter registration has begun and been terminated, areas where complaints have been lodged during the voter registration process or where the board has decided to investigate a significant irregularity in the voter registration process, are notable hurdles faced ahead of the elections.
to this end, there have been 40 constituencies where the nebe previously said elections cannot take place due to security reasons and voters’ registration irregularities.
the board announced that these constituencies affected by ballot paper defections will take place on september 6, 2021 alongside with the 40 constituencies. whereas the second round of election will be held on september 6, 2021, total of 81 constituencies will hold their election on the second round election and expected voters in those areas will be able to cast ballots before a new parliamentary session begins in early october.
“we need to hire more than 100,000 additional staff and train them on voting day procedures and tabulating results. staff shortages have been especially apparent so far in afar and somali regions, where registration started late,” explained the nebe chair.
according to the election board there are 673 constituencies over the country, and the 6th general election will be held at all of the constituencies in addis ababa, diredawa, gambela region and sidama region.
according to the new plan of the board, somali region is completely excluded from the june 21, 2021 election, according to the board even if voter registration has been completed in 14 constituencies it has been suspended due widespread procedural problem with voter registration to an investigation in the region and it is one of the regions most affected by the re-printing of ballot papers mainly because of misinformation.
as birtukan said, the voter and candidate registration in the region has been misconceived and to this end the board is investigating and also taking some administrative measures. prior to that, it will finalize and publicize issues related to voter registration.
the referendum in southwest ethiopia was scheduled to take place on june 21 with the general election, but due to security concerns, some constituencies will not be able to cast their ballots due to security concerns so the election will be held on september 6, 2021.
according to the board, voter registration has been completed in the verification process, bringing the total number of registered voters to 37.4 million. this figure does not include the 14 constituencies where voter registration has been suspended due to the investigation in the somali region, and also the number of voters in harari region.
besides, as the board announced, additional illegal 79 polling stations have been opened without the approval of the board , 2 polling stations in addis ababa, 6 with the dire dawa city administration, and 71 polling stations at south nations nationalities and peoples region without the board’s approval, which is illegal. also the board has announced that it will make a decision on the voting process before the polling day regarding the polling stations.
in benishangul-gumuz state, two constituencies (metekel, kamash) will not be held on june 21, 2021.
in the oromia region, as mentioned earlier, the seven constituencies (begi, monday market, ayana, galilee, alibo, gidami, kombolcha) will not be held on june 21, 2021.
amhara state the board has decided to hold a voting process on june 21, 2021 in one of the eight constituencies mentioned above. this was confirmed by a confirmation from the regional government that citizens in the vicinity of the five polling stations where voter registration had been disrupted were registered at other polling stations.
in addition to the four constituencies in the southern nations, nationalities and people’s region (snnpr), the budget will not be voted on by the constituent assembly on june 21; in addition, due to security concerns in gurafarda, the sheko special constituency and tepi constituency elections will not be held on june 21. as a result, the snnpr will not vote on seven constituencies on the day.
the board has said it has developed its transportation system with the cooperation of federal institutions, state governments and others based on voter registration experience using the full power of the board in transporting ballot papers.
so far the board has not announced any of its plans about the 6th national election in tigray region."
"ethiopian citizens for social justice party accuse the ruling government on its commitment to building a democratic system, claiming that it is weak.
on press conference given on thursday may 28, 2021 by ethzema, the party has said that there are many gaps in the current election and the government’s commitment to building a democratic system is weak.
“there have been many problems with our election campaign and the overall process, following the 2021 election campaign, the ruling party continued to be an obstacle to the democratic process,” said ethzema on its statement.
as the party explains, members of the ruling party are working hard to intimidate voter registration which can affect the electorate and voting on election day. “there have been various disruptions in the registration process from the beginning of voter registration on march 24, 2021 until april 25, 2021, when the registration was scheduled to be completed,” the party highlights.
also as the party said, these challenges have continued after the voter registration deadline was extended, “there were incidents of polling station staff such as late opening, closing in the afternoon and disrupting the voter registration process.”
as the accusation of ethzema stated that the first voter registration process has been a major challenge in the so-called polling stations, especially in the afar, somali, benishangul-gumuz, south (omo, gamo, gofa, silte, kembata, hadiya, kefah, bench maji) zones. even in the last few days, the polling stations in these areas have remained virtually unoccupied.
as the officers of the party remarked, some of the problems have been reported to the national election board of ethiopia /nebe/ and have been resolved, “we have seen positive efforts by the nebe to address the challenges.”
“we believe that the ruling party has placed forces in the vicinity of the polling station during the voter registration process by doing certain disruptions, including creating an image that there is no difference between prosperity and other parties, going door-to-door trying to force them out of the polling station by giving them their ballot papers and threatening them.”
“such threats have spread in the community, leading to skepticism and low participation in the election,” the ethzema party stated.
“the ruling party is struggling to implement a system of electing its successor, the eprdf, which has failed, with one-tenth of the electorate calling it a “prosperous family” without the consent of the electorate,” stated ethzema.
according to the party, in some part of the country voters could not register because they are members or leadership of political parties.
“particularly in the southern region, those who came to register to vote said they could not testify because they were members of a political party or leadership,” the party elaborated.
“on the other hand, we have seen that in the polling stations we visited, people who were not employees of the electoral board were sitting and registering as a witness for those who came to register without a document or a witness,” ethzema critiqued.
“we firmly believe that our country can overcome the multifaceted problems by forming a democratically elected government and we will continue to fight and fight until we have a government that is voluntarily appointed and abolished by the people,” said ethzema."
"ethiopian shipping and logistics services enterprise (eslse) says the effect of global box shortage is scrambling its operation from time to time. container freight rates price spikes by triple.
recently, capital reported that in relation with the global pandemic, covid 19, economic slowdown had engulfed the logistics sector. moreover, containers being stranded in different destination globally fueled to the fire as it created shortage for operators including eslse. amid this event, roba megersa, ceo of eslse, told capital this week that the effect has become severe from time to time.
he said that the activity of eslse, which had registered marvelous performance on container handling in the recent past, has significantly slowdown. “we used to be delivering containerized cargos effectively but clients and our operations are now affected by the shortage.”
the international business that mainly derives from maritime sector is becoming critical in related with mismatch on demand and supply. international reports indicated that there is no sign of easing of freight rates as demand exceeds available slots and containers.
the export from china and far east has increased by all actors including the western world thus the heavy congestion has occurred on chinese ports.
“ports and shipping operators are using it as a lucrative advantage to impose huge amount of additional sum on the logistics operation,” roba complained.
the rate of shipping for containerized cargo has tripled, “such kind of increment has never been seen in the industry.”
ports have also increased the port service fee on the reason for additional costs for the deployment system and resource, and over time fee for labour to mobilize the congestion. but the increment rate is not like shipping.
international experts on the maritime business said that terminals cannot run at full capacity, yet they have to deal with record volumes.
“currently, the export of us and others in the region has dropped significantly due to that access to container has directly affected the industry including mainly our business,” the ceo said.
the containerized export of us and latin america is on its 40 percent from the actual performance due to this effect those containers that entered in the stated region have stuck.
the global average usage time for containers had risen from 49 days to 58 days in related with the impact on container availability.
“the trade imbalance on the economic giants, china that is now on manufacturing port export boom and the us, has directly created an entire mess on the sector,” he showed the entire linkage effect on his enterprise operation.
according to roba, carriers that have contract with eslse under its tender for six months are now unable to lift cargos because of the extraordinary price.
“the latest rate is not profitable for shippers due to that they are running for their own businesses,” he said. carriers that eslse has hired under every six month tender scheme manage 80 percent of its cargos, while the remainder is covered by eslse’s vessels.
“carriers like pil, who were unable to penetrate the ethiopian market because of their untrustworthiness, have now got the opportunity to enter the market. these carriers are lifting cargos on exaggerated price of up to usd 10,000 per forty feet container and over usd 5,000 for tue that eslse is charging one third of the stated rates.
“these kind of shippers are sabotaging us in different tactics like refusing to provides slots and move cargos that we gave waivers,” he explained.
he argued that eslse is giving waivers for the sake of keeping the logistics sector to be active, “ we cannot stop the waivers because the letter of credit (lc) of clients shall be expired if cargos delays. on the other hand if customers want to extend their lc they have to pay huge sums in foreign currency. due to that we give waivers.”
experts said the waiver consignment rate that is managed by carriers like unreliable ones is much exaggerated and costs the country and clients.
under the waiver scheme clients receive their cargos at djibouti, while eslse on its multimodal operation provides value added service like delivering the cargos at its dry port or customer’s warehouse.
“because of the situation our performance has cupped on 60 percent. we had targeted to manage 18,000 containers per month that is now stuck on 11, 000,” the ceo shows the effects in figures.
unlike the previous trend the containership calls at djibouti, which registered biggest recognition on container handling by the world bank latest report, has declined by 20 percent due to the stated global situation. he said that container handling at the port is about 40 percent from its capacity.
experts said customers including projects, which were on good execution in addis ababa and elsewhere in the country that eslse gave waivers, are delayed because of working with untrustworthy carriers.
lloyd’s list latest report indicated that there is little chance of congestion in the supply chain being resolved before the fourth quarter of the year."
"“africa has to prevent an indian-scaled covid-19 tsunami from hitting its shores – because curing it after it arrives is not an option,” dr john nkengasong, director of the africa centres for disease control and prevention (cdc), has warned. the first few infections of the deadly b.1.617 variant of the coronavirus have already been picked up in africa, exacerbating fears of the spread of the covid-19 strain that is devastating india. nkengasong noted that covid-19 was still under control in africa. over the past week, the number of new infections recorded across the continent was about 65,000, a 10% drop on the week before.
the number of deaths recorded during the week was 2,181, a 0.15% decrease from the week before. but the africa cdc head noted that there was no room for complacency. india’s figures had also been relatively low, at about 3,000 new infections a day in march, before they rocketed to the present daily increases of more than 400,000. nkengasong said that, on average, africa’s health systems were too fragile to deal with such a wave of infections that had completely overwhelmed the indian health system. nkengasong warmly welcomed the us government’s decision announced on wednesday that it had rescinded its opposition to moves – led by south africa and india – to secure a waiver on the patent rights of pharmaceutical companies so that covid-19 vaccines could be produced by others more cheaply.
nkengasong said the meeting would first review the au’s continent-wide strategy for tackling covid-19 since the start of the pandemic in february last year. it would then attempt to chart a way forward for the continent and the au’s 55 member states. this would include closer monitoring of the occurrence of the different coronavirus variant strains so far detected and identifying covid-19 hotspots. it would also include quantifying the availability of vital treatments such as oxygen, something that has proven to be a critical deficiency in india.
nkengasong said we should avoid making the same mistakes and not hold political rallies or allow large religious or other gatherings. “our health systems on the continent are very fragile. we do not have the kind of supplies that india has “we don’t have enough oxygen, beds, vaccines or health workers to deal with such a massive attack,” he said. “but if we prevent it, we don’t need to get ourselves into a catastrophic situation. it’s very possible to prevent it and we have to prevent it.
scientists and public health officials are racing to understand the risk posed by a coronavirus variant known as b.1.617, which the world health organization on monday designated a global “variant of concern.”
the variant, identified in october, is a mutant form of the virus that causes covid-19. it has 13 mutations, including two notable ones in the spike protein that the virus uses to attach to and infect cells."
"ethiopian shipping and logistics services enterprise (eslse) claims that it is unable to access its own foreign currency prompt from local banks.
the state logistics giant that solely operates vessels in ethiopia said that despite having huge amounts of foreign currency in banks it is unable to access it duly when it demands to settle service charges.
the enterprise mainly working with ports in djibouti said that it has accrued sums that are supposed to be paid for the port service.
roba megersa, ceo of eslse, few weeks ago told capital that the credit that eslse was supposed to pay to the port related services has faced delays because of the foreign currency crunch.
he said that his enterprise has ample resources at banks even in foreign currency but it is unable to access when it needs.
“we have usd 92 million that is deposited in banks but we are unable to access it when we want,” he explains. “we cannot access our own foreign currency from private banks that we deposited,” roba said reminding why delays have occurred on payments that are due as a result the foreign currency shortage.
according to the ceo, through whole this challenge there is no cargo delay at djibouti ports because of service payment hold up from the ethiopian side.
“we have huge credits that are supposed to be paid to the port service, we are working with our djibouti partners on mutual benefit and trust that has been built for several years. the operation at the port is gone under guarantee framework and undertaking. we are transporting fertilizer, wheat or other cargos that are transported from ports under the stated arrangement without any delay,” roba added.
besides port charge settlement the enterprise is affected by delay on foreign currency for the procurements of products that it demanded to add on its operation.
for instance eslse has established a project office for the building of two ultramax vessels that have a capacity of 65,000 dwt, while the hard currency issue has concerned the enterprise.
currently, eslse manages the shipment of coal and fertilizer up to 70,000 tons on chartered vessels due to that the ultramax vessels are more economically viable to accommodate its consignment.
“if we get the finance it will be done within two years,” the ceo said. the two vessels may cost usd 70 million.
the flag carrier, eslse, is one of the oldest cross continent vessel operators in the world since it managed the first vessels in march 1964 and now the only in africa.
currently, it is mainly manages 11 dry cargo ships. from the stated, two vessels are tankers and the nine are general cargo vessels called ‘handysize’ with the capacity of 28, 000 dwt.
ethiopia loads its cargos from 340 ports in the world and eslse has agents that have been working for several decades."
"local instability has dragged down the holiday market which was recovering from the pandemic hit after a year. being a holiday season in the form of easter and ramadan the market is expected to increase because of perceived increase in demand against shortage in commodity.
in ethiopia, where more than half of the population is assumed to be following the orthodox faith, easter is welcomed after an eight week of fast for most. moreover, easter is one of the major holidays that ethiopians celebrate. on easter eve, christian-ethiopians participate in hours-long church service that ends around 3 a.m. on sunday, after which they break their fast.
it is always a familiar sight to see the markets full to the brim during the last days of the holiday. however this time round most of the consumers seem to be complaining about the prices of commodities. furthermore, the traders themselves are complaining that the market condition has escalated above proportion.
the food items price spike continues to be a headache to majority of the population. in most of the huge markets in the city as capital has observed the market is showing no signs of price decrease. both food items and non-food items are shooting in price as supply of the commodity is showing shortage. also there are instances of high shake over in terms of the price of vegetables and grains including teff, and other necessities which has lasted over a month which has financial burdened the population.
when consumers’ on one end complain about the price in the market, traders on the other end reply that the country’s situation and instability has resulted in the hike of commodities.
mostly cattle, butter, eggs and chicken come to the city from various parts of the country, mainly from harar, gojjam, arbaminch and jimma. however, as result of uprising conflicts in the country have made traders to fear to move from place to place thus the price of some products are increasing with double and some showing some significant increment.
kera, akaki, shegole, bercheko are the largest cattle markets receiving cattle from different parts of the country, mainly from harar, wellega, bahirdar, jimma, gonder and wolayita among others. usually, sale of livestock inside the center reflects significant seasonal variations on demand and supply. 
in kera, the largest cattle market in the city, traders informed capital that the price of cattle is showing a 4000 up to 8000 birr price increase compare to the last year, the supply of cattle comes from far and wide from the likes of harar, wellega, bahirdar, jimma, gonder and wolayita mostly used for the celebration. according to the traders, usually, the price is based on the type, size and origin of the cattle. “recent unrest in some parts of the country has made it difficult to receive cattle from parts of the country. and on the last two days of the holiday the price is expected to be raised even more,” expressed one trader in an interview.
in other parts of the city at the shola market traders are selling an egg for 5.50 to 6.00 birr which was 3.50 to 5.00 birr last year, whereas a chicken would set consumers back between 470-650 birr based on their size which was between 300 birr to 500 birr last year. “last year covid had decreased the demand of chicken since people did not show much interest to buy cattle like they used to buy,” said on cattle seller at kera and shola. the other necessary commodity which is butter is ranging from 450-580, which was 250 birr and 320 birr last easter.
according to the central statics agency, headline inflation in the month of march, 2021 has recorded 20.2 percent increase. most of the components of food index showed increase as compared to similar months last year where food items recorded 22.6 percent increase in march 2021 as compared to the one observed in december 2020 whereas non-food items stood at 17.1 percent.
bread and cereals by 29.7 percent, meat 11.9 percent, fish and seafood by 41 percent, milk, cheese and eggs 32.8 percent, oil and fats 22.1 percent, fruits by 6.4 percent, vegetables and pulses, potatoes and tubers by 16.1 percent, sugar, honey and chocolate declined by 14.5 percent, other food products and spices by 16.8 percent and non-alcoholic beverages and coffee by 19.6 percent, were recorded.
this means that during the coming festive season, consumers will have to dig a bit deeper than before to have a wholesome festive season.
with regards to overall inflation, cereal prices have continued to increase in the current month which has been a great contributor for the rise of food inflation. in addition, vegetables and pulses types have registered an increase in their price in the current month.
on the other hand, the continued surge in the prices of edible oil, spices (pepper), fruits, vegetables, potatoes, and coffee during the current month has similarly played a pivotal role in increasing the rate of inflation.
the annual inflation rate showed an increase in the current month since prices were relatively lower in the same month last year. the non-food inflation showed rapid growth rate of 18.9 percent in march 2021 as compared to the one observed in march 2020. the rise in non-food inflation is mainly due to rise in the prices of alcohol and tobacco, stimulants (chat), clothing and footwear, housing repair and maintenance (cement and corrugated iron sheets), and energy (firewood and charcoal), medical care, transport (fuel) and jewelry (gold). inflation based on comparison of current vs. last month at country level (month-on-month) in general cpi for march 2021 has showed an increase of 2.9 percent as compared to the preceding month. the monthly inflation rate measures the price change between the two latest months. although up to date, it can be affected by seasonal and other short term effects.
addis ababa city trade bureau announced that distribution activities are underway to make basic consumer products accessible to the public through easter and eid al-fitr holidays. addis ababa city trade bureau head, abdulfatah youssef, toured the sub-cities where consumer cooperatives are preparing for the upcoming eid and eid al-fitr festivities. consumer cooperatives in various sub-cities have also provided oil, sugar, teff, wheat flour, eggs, butter and various agricultural and industrial products."
"getting senior bankers has become difficult in the fast growing banking industry where there is a come up in the massive number of new banks. further, the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) says unhealthy remuneration development is observed in the banking industry.
human capital development experts and professionals in the banking industry said that the banking sector is struggling to hold up the seasoned experienced staff at the senior level including the directorial position, while the new entrants are experiencing trouble in grabbing experienced experts at the medium level to key managerial posts.
experts like gemechu waktoal, professor at addis ababa university and founder of the i-capital africa institute that is engaged on consulting companies like banks on the development of human capital besides its different activities, says the challenge is expected since there is weakness in producing skilled labour. furthermore, he expressed there is lack of attention for developing succession plan internally at the banks in addition to other external factors.
according to the sector experts, on the external side besides limitation of producing qualified and competitive experts, the nbe’s strict requirement at the senior management when hiring has presented a challenge.
head hunting and filling the required staff for the new entrants and fighting to hold bankers at the established banks has become one of the discussed issues at the sector arena. capital has got different information from sources that show the value of bank experts spiking in relation to factor of grabbing or losing the financial firms from one to the other.
the banking sector has become one of the leading fields that pay huge sums as salary besides providing different incentives.
for instance, recently one of the bank presidents has secured a double promotion in his salary as a result of board of director fearing to loss him in addition to his value as seen from the stakeholders who appreciate his achievements.
similarly, senior bankers in different banks are getting different incentives like providing tens of millions of birr loan scheme and giving bank shares besides an attractive and extraordinary salary increment.
“the recent scheme of providing different encouragement initiatives by banks for their employees might vary from position to position but most of the beneficiaries are those who worked for many years at the given bank and that are engaged on the activities from a director level,” one of a senior bankers at one of the long established bank told capital.
on the other hand the new entrants are in trouble when it comes to acquiring experts in different positions including chief executive officer or president, which is required in order to get a license for operation from nbe.
experts said for these up and coming new banks one of the burden and major cost is salary because they have to pay a competitive sum to attract skilled labour, who shall come from well established financial firms.
frezer ayalew, banking supervision directorate director at nbe, agreed on the tendency tof unhealthy development in staff benefits. “recently, there has been an unhealthy remuneration development in the banking industry, but one needs to ask is it really related with lack of skilled labour in the industry,” he expressed.
a bank expert who manages a key position at one of the oldest private banks assured that the latest move by bank owners and boards is directly related with the shortage of skilled and qualified professionals as per the standard of nbe. he added that losing staff even at the branch or lower level might have effect for any given bank.
he said that operational banks should hold their staffs especially those who have key roles in the banking activity because the damage is not only related with losing a staff but also in relation to the day to day activity at the centre and even at the branches.
“owners of are not only afraid of losing staff but also their clients and proficiency since a staff would not leave a bank alone,” he explained.
“stalling and implementing others strategies and drawing vulnerability from company business secrets when you get the chance is unfair,” gemechu stated arguing that such moves are against professionalism and ethics.
“so it creates a lose win situation in the business besides labour movement from one place to another,” he added.
he added that it is practical that within very few years, experts shall move up to four banks, which shows how much the sector is at huge risk.
gemechu with his insight said that based on the experience that the sector has been through; access to qualified experts would be eroded. he said banks did not work on skill development and most of them do not have succession plan and are not focused on producing and qualifying new leaders, “due to that of course the pool will be dry which leads to push factors.”
“i know there are about two strong banks working on supersession planning but most of them are not with it and some of them do not even understand the issue of working human capital development,” he explained the reason for the scarcity of qualified leaders besides the strong rule of nbe.
he said that because of the requirement, new banks are supposed to hire experienced bankers as per the nbe directive. “just how many of them have been under operational preparedness for their lower level staffs as they open their doors? they are simply awaiting the licenses and then engage on taking others from existing established banks.”
he said that the nbe directive, which for instance requires presidents to have at least 12 year of experience out of which 5 year should be spent at a vice president level in the banking industry. this requirement limits the scope for the human capital search thus new banks focus on acquiring top notch bankers from other banks reeling them in with attractive benefits; of course this is of great benefit to the experts because of demand of expertise.
according to the leader of the i-capital africa institute, a consulting firm that delivers intellectual capital development packages; when the source is becomes dry, the sector shall look into other alternatives to fill the gap. “there might be use of experts from abroad as per nbe criteria, while it is embarrassing for a country with concerns of high graduates with high unemployment rate.”
“when banks are unable to fill the gap from the local pool of talent they will seek to import professionals,” another expert on the banking industry, who demands anonymity said explaining that those who come from abroad may not have similar expertise and bank practice that is found with ethiopia.
he also underlined that the regulatory body, nbe, itself may not have a capacity to control the expats that have huge experience in the dynamic sector. “the banking sector in ethiopia is very traditional, while those who come from abroad have huge exposure on the global market that would be difficult for nbe to manage them,” he added.
future
experts in the sector insist the central bank to relax its directive. “i understand the motive of nbe which is considerate of trust and experience which is set as a criterion but similarly the realty should also look into talents alongside length of experience,” gemechu said.
he recommended internal and external solutions to mitigate the challenge that will be applied as soon as possible.
“the regulatory body should consider the dynamism on the sector, and banks on their part to apply multilayer intervention,” he added.
frezer said that nbe does not have a plan to change the directive that it amended in 2019 under the directive number sbb/70/2019.
the directive stated senior executive officers mainly referring to vice presidents indicated that they have a minimum of 10 years of experience in the banking, of which, 4 years as department manager and other senior executive if directly reporting for the board of directors to have 8 year experience and three years on managerial position.
“currently, there are 18 banks in business the new comers shall get vice presidents with nbe requirements from them,” he added otherwise there will be no change regarding relaxing the directive,” the banking supervision directorate director told capital.
according to the i-capital africa institute leader, internally the board of directors of a bank should work on talent and succession strategy mainly on key roles like what they do today on profit escalation.
“they have to also establish and hire qualified experts on capacity building department,” gemechu said.
“the banking sector, which is knowledge based industry, shows dynamism from time to time on different conditions like on fin-tech, covid 19 leads new approaches and others. due to that the knowledge expansion is required with different approaches which focused on specialized certifications,” he added.
he reminded that nbe has enforced banks to allocate two percent of their revenue for skill development but that should be properly revisited by the regulatory for its effectiveness.
gemechu said the ethiopian bankers association should take its role on the area.
frezer reminded that nbe is working to revamp and massively engage on knowledge development at its facility located at akaki.
“of course the financial sector is strictly regulated but i am afraid that it would affect the industry’s health that may leads to crisis,” an expert said."
"the international monetary fund’s (imf) world economic outlook (weo) forecasts ethiopia’s consumer price would drop to a single digit.
imf forecasts ethiopia’s real gdp growth will go up to 8.7 percent by 2022, while its projection for 2021 is two percent which was stated as 6.1 percent in 2020. according to the imf estimation, the country gdp growth will stand at 8 percent by 2026.
the movement of consumer price estimation is 13.1 percent for this year and 8 percent by 2022 that was 20.4 percent in 2020.
it has projected that the deficit of current account balance is to be narrowed to 3.6 percent in 2021, while it would extend to 3.9 percent in next year, which was 4.6 percent for the year in 2020.
in the latest history of ethiopia, the biggest current account balance deficit was registered in 2015 and 2016 that was 11.7 percent and 9.2 percent respectively.
imf on its latest weo that released on wednesday april 6 evening highlighted that high uncertainty surrounds the global economic outlook, primarily related to the path of the pandemic.
it said that after an estimated contraction of negative 3.3 percent in 2020, the global economy is projected to grow at 6 percent in 2021, moderating to 4.4 percent in 2022.
“the contraction for 2020 is 1.1 percentage points smaller than projected in the october 2020 weo, reflecting the higher-than-expected growth outturns in the second half of the year for most regions after lockdowns were eased and as economies adapted to new ways of working,” it added."
"djibouti’s ismail omar guelleh was re-elected for a fifth term as president with more than 98 percent of the vote, according to provisional results announced early on saturday april 10.
about 215,000 citizens were registered to vote in the ballot pitting ismail omar guelleh, 73, against a businessman and a political newcomer zakaria ismail farah.
counting started shortly after polling stations closed on friday april 9, in the horn of africa nation, which overlooks one of the world’s busiest trade routes at the crossroads between africa and the arabian peninsula.
“president ismail omar guelleh obtained 167,535 votes, which is 98.58 percent,” interior minister moumin ahmed cheick told public broadcaster rtd early on saturday, adding that confirmed results would be released soon by the constitutional council.
independent election observers said the process went smoothly, with no reports of misconduct.
in a social media post early on saturday, ismail omar guelleh wrote, “thank you for your trust, thank you for djibouti! together, let’s continue!”
earlier, after voting in the capital where most of djibouti’s one million people reside, guelleh praised the trouble-free conduct of the electoral exercise.
dressed in immaculate white traditional robes, he said he was “very, very confident” of victory, after placing his vote in a transparent ballot box.
zakaria ismail farah, a 56-year-old cleaning products importer, ended up with less than 5,000 votes, according to the provisional results.
ahmed tidiane souare, the head of an african union (au) observer mission, said all candidates were free to send their officials to any polling station.
zakaria ismail farah, who had styled himself as the “flag bearer of poor djiboutians”, had alleged unfair treatment during the election campaign, including that he was not provided security at his rallies."
"the covid-19 pandemic has exposed the terrible legacy of deliberately divisive and destructive policies that have perpetuated inequality, discrimination, and oppression across sub-saharan africa, amnesty international said in its annual report published today.
across the region, the devastating impact of armed conflict in countries such as ethiopia, mozambique, cameroon, and nigeria, was compounded by the pandemic as a number of states weaponized it to crack down on human rights. the crackdowns included killings of civilians and arrests of opposition politicians and supporters and human rights defenders and activists in countries such as angola, guinea, and uganda.
amnesty international report 2020/21: the state of the world’s human rightscovers 149 countries – including 35 in sub-saharan africa – and delivers a comprehensive analysis of human rights trends globally in 2020.
in it, the organization highlights conflicts between states and armed groups and attacks on civilians continuing or escalating in most parts of the region.
“conflicts between states and armed groups and attacks on civilians have continued or escalated in most parts of sub-saharan africa. in southern africa, the long simmering violent tensions in mozambique’s cabo delgado province intensified into full-blown armed conflict. the horn of africa region saw an outbreak of conflict in ethiopia’s tigray region,” said deprose muchena, amnesty international director for east and southern africa.
“at the same time, armed groups maintained a foothold in west africa and the sahel region, attacking civilians in burkina faso, mali, niger, and nigeria. they blighted many lives in cameroon, the central african republic (car) and chad. in response, state security forces also committed grave human rights violations against civilians,”
pandemic has amplified decades of inequalities
the report also describes those already most marginalized, including women and refugees, as bearing the devastating brunt of the covid-19 pandemic, as a result of discriminatory policy decisions by leaders in the region.
“covid-19 has brutally exposed and deepened inequality across sub-saharan africa. governments should urgently re-invest in people and “repair” the broken economic and social system which perpetuates poverty and inequality, including leaving too many behind,” said samira daoud, amnesty international west and central africa director.
amnesty’s report shows how existing inequalities have left marginalized communities, refugees, older people, health workers, and women disproportionately negatively affected by the pandemic, with gender-based violence exacerbating the situation.
covid-19 worsened the already precarious situation of refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in many countries, trapping some in squalid camps, cutting off vital supplies, or precipitating border controls that left many stranded.
for example, uganda, the largest refugee-hosting country in africa with 1.4 million refugees, immediately closed its borders at the start of the pandemic and did not make an exception for refugees and asylum seekers trying to enter the country. as a result, over 10,000 people were stranded along its border with the democratic republic of congo (drc).
the report highlights a marked increase in gender-based and domestic violence with many women facing increased barriers to protection and support due to restrictions on freedom of movement.
for example, 21 women and children had been killed by intimate partners in south africa by mid-june, while over 3,600 rapes were recorded during the covid-19 lockdown in nigeria. in car, the un recorded 60 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, including rape, forced marriage, and sexual slavery, between june and october.
health workers operated in insanitary and unsafe environments
across the region, many working in the informal sector have been left without an income or social protections due to lockdowns and curfews. health workers operated in insanitary and unsafe environments due to shortages of ppe and sanitizers.
for example, in south africa, by early august, at least 240 health workers had died after contracting covid-19. by july, about 2,065 health workers in ghana had been infected and six had died due to covid-19-related complications. despite facing increased workloads and additional occupational risks, health workers in most countries remained without adequate compensation.
weaponizing the pandemic to further assault human rights
the report also paints a dismal picture of countries where authorities continued to restrict liberties in their handling of the pandemic.
from togo to kenya and angola to south africa, the annual report highlights governments using excessive force to enforce compliance with covid-19 response measures.
“in many countries, authorities violated freedom of expression and peaceful assembly to silence critical voices leading to large numbers of arbitrary detentions and killings of demonstrators,” said samira daoud.
authorities using legislation criminalizing commentary related to the pandemic has been a presiding pattern. they used the covid-19 pandemic as a pretext to continue suppressing the right to freedom of expression, including by prosecuting individuals, who posted comments on social media about government responses to the pandemic, for spreading “false news”.
use of excessive force led to several cases of multiple killings, including while enforcing covid-19 measures. in nigeria, brutal policing has resulted in security forces killing people for protesting in the streets, demanding their rights, and calling for accountability. in zimbabwe at least 10 people were killed, while thousands including protesters, were arbitrarily arrested and detained in the context of enforcing covid-19 measures. in guinea, seven people were killed during demonstrations against the security forces’ enforcement of covid-19 movement restrictions.
some leaders have gone a step further, using the distraction of the pandemic to clamp down on criticism – and critics – unrelated to the virus, and perpetrate other human rights violations. for example, in tanzania, authorities further cracked down on civil society activists, including through restricting human rights such as freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly ahead of the october election.
the crackdown on protests in guinea resulted in the deaths of dozens of people, hundreds injured and more than 70 others arbitrary detained. in niger, human rights defenders calling for anti-corruption protests were arbitrarily arrested.
dozens of people were arbitrarily arrested in august in côte d’ivoire for having participated in demonstrations against president ouattara’s running for a third term. a nationwide ban on demonstrations was issued in cameroon after the opposition cameroon renaissance movement (mrc) called for the resignation of the president and hundreds of demonstrators were arbitrarily arrested.
“regional institutions have failed to make respect by states their founding principles on human rights protection. some states like benin and cote d’ivoire have contributed to the fragility of regional institutions like the african court on human and peoples’ rights by preventing individuals and ngos direct access to the court,” said deprose muchena.
“the pandemic has cast a harsh light on the failure to cooperate effectively in times of dire global need. the only way out of this mess is through international cooperation. states must ensure vaccines are quickly available to everyone, everywhere, and free at the point of use. pharmaceutical companies must share their knowledge and technology so no one is left behind. g20 members and international financial institutions must provide debt relief for the poorest 77 countries to respond and recover from pandemic.”
failed by their governments, protest movements the world over have stood up
regressive policies have inspired many people to join long-standing struggles as seen with #zimbabweanlivesmatter, against constant human rights violations and the #end sars protests in nigeria as well as the #shutitalldown protests to spotlight gender-based violence in namibia among others.
the report details many important victories that human rights activists helped to secure in 2020. these include new legislation to counter violence against women and girls in sudan. in sierra leone, the government overturned a ban preventing pregnant girls from attending school and sitting exams, following years of campaigning by amnesty and other partners.
“leadership in 2020 came not from power or privilege. it came from the countless people marching to demand change. we saw an outpouring of support for #end sars, #zimbabweanlivesmatter as well as public protests against repression and inequality in places across the continent. often risking their own safety, it was the leadership of ordinary people and human rights defenders the world over that urged us on. these are the people at the frontier of the struggle for a better, safer and more equal world,” said samira daoud.
“we are at a crossroads. we must release the shackles that degrade human dignity. we must reset and reboot to build a world grounded in equality, human rights, and humanity. we must learn from the pandemic and come together to work boldly and creatively so everyone is on an equal footing,” added deprose muchena."
"the united nations warned that the devastating socio-economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic will be felt for years to come unless smart investments in economic, societal and climate resilience ensure a robust and sustainable recovery of the global economy.
in 2020, the world economy shrank by 4.3 per cent, over two and half times more than during the global crisis of 2009. the modest recovery of 4.7 per cent expected in 2021 would barely offset the losses of 2020, says the latest world economic situation and prospects.
developed economies, projected to see a 4 per cent output growth in 2021, shrank the most, by 5.6 per cent, due to economic shutdowns and subsequent waves of the pandemic, increasing the risk of premature austerity measures that would only derail recovery efforts globally. developing countries saw a less severe contraction at 2.5 per cent, with an expected rebound of 5.6 per cent in 2021, according to the estimates presented in the report. however, economic contraction among developing nations, falling exports and local consumption rates as well as high levels of public debt will significantly increase poverty levels, says the report.
african countries are experiencing an unprecedented economic downturn with major adverse impacts on development. lower commodity prices, the collapse of tourism and lower remittances – exacerbated by much-needed domestic lockdowns and other measures to control the spread of the pandemic – have caused a severe and widespread deterioration of the economic situation. limited fiscal space, challenging financing conditions and rising public debt have increased the risks of debt distress.
“we are facing the worst health and economic crisis in 90 years. as we mourn the growing death toll, we must remember that the choices we make now will determine our collective future,” said un secretary-general antónio guterres, who will address the davos agenda event later today. “let’s invest in an inclusive and sustainable future driven by smart policies, impactful investments, and a strong and effective multilateral system that places people at the heart of all socio-economic efforts.”
the report underscores that sustained recovery from the pandemic will depend not only on the size of the stimulus measures, and the quick rollout of vaccines, but also on the quality and efficacy of these measures to build resilience against future shocks.
an unprecedented downturn with major consequences for development in africa
despite the relatively few number of cases compared to the number of cases in other continents, the covid-19 pandemic will continue to strongly impact living conditions and development progress in africa. the crisis is already increasing unemployment, poverty and inequality. most countries are facing enormous challenges to keep the pandemic under control and mobilize financial resources to support health systems, protect vulnerable groups, and support the recovery.
after a contraction of 3.4 per cent in 2020, africa is projected to achieve a modest recovery, with regional gdp expanding by 3.4 per cent in 2021. this recovery is predicated on the rise of domestic demand and the pick-up of exports and commodity prices.
nigeria’s gdp is projected to expand by 1.5 per cent in 2021, after a contraction of 3.5 per cent in 2020. yet, tighter foreign exchange liquidity, mounting inflationary pressures and subdued domestic demand cloud the medium-term outlook. in south africa, gdp is projected to expand by 3.3 per cent in 2021, after a contraction of 7.7 per cent in 2020. however, a strong and sustained recovery remains uncertain, amid power shortages, elevated public debt and policy challenges.
egypt’s gdp is estimated to have grown by 0.2 per cent in 2020; and in 2021, gdp growth is projected to climb to 5.4 per cent, underpinned by a strong recovery of domestic demand and facilitated by the absence of severe balance-of-payments constraints. after a contraction of 0.5 per cent in 2020, the ethiopian economy is projected to expand by only 2.3 per cent in 2021. while agricultural exports are showing resilience, the tourism sector will remain restrained throughout 2021.
external financing and high debt levels pose major risks
elevated public debt is limiting the capacity to boost spending across the continent. also, meagre growth prospects mean less capacity to sustain debt levels, as foreign reserves, remittances and capital flows falter and depreciations constrain the capacity to service foreign currency-denominated debt. african countries need further support from the international community and strong national efforts in averting a debt crisis. a debt crisis would not just cause a further economic deterioration, but also force painful fiscal adjustments. against such a backdrop, social unrest and political tensions may easily escalate, which could in turn worsen food insecurity, violence, internal displacement and migration pressures.
a strong and sustained recovery requires decisive policy actions
africa needs a sustained revival of growth. while a focus on the short term is essential, african countries need to lay the groundwork for a strong and inclusive development path in the medium term, which entail the creation of decent jobs at a large scale.
“as countries will emerge from the crisis with higher levels of debt, a careful rebalancing of policy priorities will be required to build resilience and boost productivity,” said hamid rashid, chief of the global economic monitoring branch at the un department of economic and social affairs, and the lead author of the report. “this includes unlocking growth opportunities and accelerating technology adoption and bridging digital divides, enhancing climate resilience and boosting domestic revenue mobilization.”
the report highlights the need for african countries to prioritize the diffusion of digital technologies, supported by the expansion of affordable and universal digital infrastructure. an effective framework for the implementation of the african continental free trade area could also become a major tool for promoting intra-african trade, food security and productivity."
"internally displaced persons (idps) in tigray region have surpassed the one million mark. the dire situation in the northern part of the country, tigray region, remains concerning as the number of idps soars from day to day with conflict continuing in some parts of the region. the total population of tigray region is estimated to stand at 5.5 million of which more than 1 million have been internally displaced by the current situation in the region.
“violence and lack of assistance in the region especially in rural areas have driven displacement of people searching for safety and aid in the main towns across tigray,” said etenesh negussie, communication head of the new interim government of the region.
“up to this week, around 92,000 idps have entered the city of mekelle,” highlighted etenesh. in addition according to the norwegian refugee council /nrc/, over 400,000 people fleeing intensifying conflict in western tigray have recently arrived in shire adding that 4.5 million people in tigray region require humanitarian assistance.
as she said, there is a continues displacement of people from the western part of the region due to the tension between amhara and tigray ethnic groups, also the strain around eritrea boarder and the unstopped conflict around the southern part of the region has aggravate the situation.
even though it is becoming difficult to assist and support all the idps, it has been reported that people in the region are trying to reach towns where assistance is being delivered. similarly, as etenesh told capital, the regional government is working to build camps for the internally displaced persons in the town of mekelle.
thousands of people, who have been sheltering in schools and universities and already living in extremely concerning conditions, are facing the prospect of relocation within one month due to back-to-school plans.
“humanitarian partners are facing significant difficulties in identifying suitable alternative sites for displaced people and are stressing the urgent need to provide emergency shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene services, as well as supporting the management of settlements.
to date, nearly 62,000 refugees have been registered at the crossing points along the sudan-ethiopia border. to this end, humanitarian response efforts are focused on filling the existing gap in service delivery in the reception facilities.
it has been over four months since the law enforcement operation started in the tigray region following the 4th of november 2020 attack on the northern command of ethiopian national defense force (endf) by the tigray liberation front.
after three weeks of military offense in tigray region to enforce law and bring in the so called criminal group of tigray peoples liberation front /tplf/ leaders on november 28, the government has announced the battle came to an end after taking mekele, the capital city of the region, from the so called criminal group of tplf.
it is to be recalled that the house of federation had endorsed to establish an interim administration in tigray regional state following the defiant tplf. the interim administration was established with the participation of independent and neutral scholars and political parties operating in tigray.
prime minister abiy, on the 3rd of march, announced that aid agencies can operate in the region by providing a notification to the ministry of peace. following this significant development, organizations have begun notifying the ministry and are working to urgently improve access to rural areas.
following the transition to a flexible notification system for access, several organizations have deployed international staff to tigray to scale up of the response.
despite some progress in accessible areas, many people remain in hard-to-reach areas due to insecurity, logistical and administrative hurdles, where assistance is needed."
"africa’s economy should return to growth in aggregate across the continent in 2021 after a coronavirus recession, the african development bank said friday, while warning that poverty and public debt would continue to rise.
the 2.1-percent contraction of the pan-african economy in 2020 was the first recession in half a century but should give way to the expansion of 3.4 percent this year, the afdb said in the 2021 edition of its african economic outlook report.
at 3.1 percent, the international monetary fund’s forecast was less optimistic than the afdb, whose mission is to fund investment in african countries and offer advice and technical assistance to development.
the development bank predicted the strongest rebound for economies like morocco, tunisia and mauritius that depend on tourism, at 6.2 percent – although their gdp fell the furthest last year.
meanwhile, oil and raw materials exporters like algeria, nigeria, angola and south africa should enjoy the growth of around three percent, and the continent’s most diversified economies like ethiopia and ivory coast rise by 4.1 percent, having already suffered a softer 2020 blow.
the afdb report also highlighted that 39 million more people could slip below the extreme poverty threshold of $1.90 per day this year, up from an estimated 30 million last year.
a total of 465 million people in africa could be affected by extreme poverty, one-third of the continent’s population, in a setback after two decades of steady reductions.
meanwhile “the pandemic shock and ensuing economic crisis have had direct implications for budgetary balances and debt burdens,” the afdb warned.
deficits roughly doubled last year, to around 8.4 percent of gdp, while the average debt-to-gdp ratio on the continent is expected to surge by between 10 and 15 percentage points, to around 70 percent.
by december, 14 of 38 countries analyzed for debt sustainability were judged “in high risk of debt distress”, with 16 seen as moderate risk and just two at low risk.
“serious debt challenges might be looming, and disorderly defaults and lengthy resolutions could become a major obstacle to africa’s progress toward prosperity,” afdb president akinwumi adesina wrote in the report.
“we need to address africa’s debt and development finance challenges, in partnership with the international community” and with private creditors, he added.
but adesina also urged leaders to enact “bold governance reforms to eliminate all forms of leakages in public resources, improve domestic resource mobilization, and enhance transparency”.
the 2021 edition of the african economic outlook focuses on debt resolution, governance, and growth in africa."
"“a vibrant construction sector is an indisputable driver of gdp growth in a country,” said bartholomew armah, director of macroeconomics and governance at the economic commission for africa (eca).
he was speaking during a ministerial webinar organized on 23 february to present african member states with the latest in a series of quarterly briefings to ministers of finance by the eca price watch centre for africa, which focused on ‘price evolution in the construction sector.’
“construction is a key lever in infrastructure development and plays a crucial role in an economy, providing essential structures including public and private infrastructure, and housing,” said armah who also cited ethiopia, angola, and tanzania as amongst the top countries where construction contributed significantly to gdp in 2019.
he noted, however, that the sector has been severely impacted by covid-19, resulting in a 45% loss in economic activity in 2020.
in the same vein, the director of the africa centre for statistics at the eca, oliver chinganya deplored the fact that, “construction prices have increased in many countries, threatening the affordability of decent housing, and becoming a heavy load for infrastructure development. this is triggered, largely, by the lockdown measures institutes by governments.”
according to the report, the average price increase in most african countries is higher than 3% annually. this could be attributed to a number of factors that vary from country to country such as exchange rate, high import taxes, and prices in other sectors.
chinganya noted that with the halting of construction projects due to covid-19, “construction workers have become jobless” thereby adding to existing burden of unemployment and poverty in many countries.
the report notes that construction grew more (over 5% yearly) in fastest growing economies such as ethiopia, mali, djibouti, rwanda, côte d’ivoire, tanzania, senegal, and togo. countries with more moderate growth such as niger, benin, kenya, uganda, gambia, guinea-bissau, egypt, cabo verde, drc, cameroon, and madagascar also recorded strong annual growth of 3-5% in the construction industry.
the study recommends that countries should prioritize investments in the construction sector, given its potential to significantly drive economic growth without necessarily equating to inflation. countries are also urged to develop infrastructure methods and materials that are environmentally friendly while prioritizing the use of local materials and green building practices.
armah pointed out that, analyses for the construction price levels were done mainly with use of the “deflator of gross value added as an indication of price level.” this is because very few countries in africa conduct comprehensive economic surveys or surveys on cost of building materials or construction.
in a media briefing held earlier on 22 february to present the report to the press, chinganya made a clarion call for countries to invest in data collection. “data is key. we cannot do this without the full collaboration of our member states,” he said.
the eca price watch centre for africa is a reference on latest price developments on the continent, offering decision-makers in africa a unique view of most recent price developments in country, sub-regional and at continental level, in support of short to medium-term economic governance, and long term sustainable development planning.
the next price watch discussion will focus on energy pricing. eca has embarked on activities to fortify its collaboration with national statistics offices and research institutions to enhance data collection and analyses."
"ethiopian commodity exchange /ecx/ grabs 19.8 billion birr revenue and 119 million birr in profit in the first half of the current fiscal year. during the half, ecx also launched its forth electronics market center at gonder in amhara region meanwhile it is building two new electronic market centers at adama and jimma.
in the last six month, the commodity exchange center has sold 320,000 tons of commodities worth 19.8 billion, which is 99 percent of the target in terms of volume and 111 percent in value from the targeted 323,694 ton commodity.
when it compares to last year same period the number has shown 5 percent decline in volume and 13 percent in value. the conflict break out in the northern part of the country where oil seeds are highly produced has disrupted farmers and producers to supply their products, also contraband trading has been a challenge facing the commodity trading according to the ceo, wendmagegnew negera.
“increasing of the international commodity price has played a role to the increase of the revenue than expected,” said the ceo explaining how ecx grabbed 119 million profits in the last six month.
ecx has been working aggressively to fill the gap on the oilseed trade disrupted by the conflict break out in the tigray regional state. “at the time of the conflict ecx has facilitated optional branches to farmers to provide their production at abrehajira and gonder branches. “even if it is a peak season for trading oil seeds, the instability has not affected the trading that much,” the ceo stated.
from the 320,000 tons of commodity sesame has taken the majority share of 140,000 tons which is 122 percent of the plan which was 115,000 tons. in the special marketing window for agro-processing industries launched on october 2020, ecx has also traded 10,592 tons of soya beans by 198 million birr. although as wendmagegnehu said the volume of coffee has shown decline from previous times. therefore ethiopia’s oilseed sector plays an important role in generating foreign exchange earnings. the three major oilseed crops (sesame, soybean, and niger seed) contribute to nearly 20 percent of ethiopia’s total agricultural export earnings, second only to coffee.
ecx has three electronic market center at hawassa, humera, and nekemte and next week it will launch its forth at gonder. furthermore, it is building two new branches at mizan tefferi and tepi. it will be launching two new warehouses in bule hora and metu. ecx has also done a feasibility study to start trading nine more products, including cotton, spices and pulses. with the addition of bean sprouts and white pigeons, the number of commodities on the market shall increases to 12 items. in particular, the pickled bean sprouts include red, white, gray, cream, yellow, and black beans
in the last six months ecx also trained 698 traders in e-commerce and e-bidding and received certificates. – training was also been provided to 517 stakeholders and professionals in various woredas and cities on product quality rating.
“in new and emerging e-commerce centers, we are making extensive use of the system to enable farmers and suppliers to sell their products directly without being a member of the commodity exchange,” ecx elaborated.
recently enat and zemen banks also joined the ecx transaction to enable farmers and suppliers implement modern farming, allowing ecx to working with all commercial banks in the country. currently ecx has 23 branches that have warehouses for receiving and delivering of agriculture products. similarly, feasibility study has been undergone to open branches at shakiso, bahirdar and kelem –welega.
in the payment process 379 million birr, two percent withholding tax and 30 million vat has also been collected. ecx plans to trade 784 thousand tons of produce this fiscal year."
"immature locust swarms continue to migrate southwards from different breeding areas in eastern africa, the food and agriculture organization (fao) said monday.
in its desert locust situation update, the fao cited the migration of immature swarms from eastern ethiopia and central somalia to southern ethiopia and northern kenya.
it also showed that a few immature swarms recently reached mwanga district in northeast tanzania.
“in kenya, immature swarms continue to arrive and spread throughout the north. so far, swarms are present in the four counties of wajir, garissa, marsabit and, most recently, isiolo,” said the fao.
“breeding continues, and hopper bands are present in the southeast [kenya] near taita taveta and along the coast.”
in ethiopia, according to the fao, immature swarms have concentrated along the eastern side of the harar highlands in the oromia region on their way to southern areas of the country, including southern parts of the rift valley region.
the situation update also indicated that there are cross-border movements of locusts in areas around the northwest of somalia and along the southern border with kenya.
the un agency called on all countries to maintain the necessary survey and control operations to reduce migration and breeding.
it also warned that dry conditions in some areas where the swarms are arriving could facilitate their spread throughout southern ethiopia and northern kenya.
there is a moderate risk that a few swarms could reach central kenya and perhaps the southwest as well as northeast tanzania, eastern uganda and southeast south sudan in january, according to the fao.
“once swarms arrive in favorable areas, they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and cause hopper bands to form during february and march,” said the fao, reaffirming its commitment to control measures, which it said would continue in all affected countries in east africa.
last year witnessed the most serious outbreak of desert locusts in recent years which spread across east africa, posing an unprecedented threat to food security.
five countries have been especially hard hit by the african migratory locusts: ethiopia, kenya, somalia, sudan, and yemen. as a result, more than 35 million people suffer from food insecurity. fao estimates this number could increase to 38.5 million if nothing is done to control the new infestation."
"ethiopian red cross society (ercs) demands 9 billion birr to asses’ humanitarian assistance in the 4 regions affected by conflict and violence.
according to ercs assessment on the current conflict and violence on the ground, a total of 0.53 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in tigray, amhara, snnp and benishangul-gumuz regions which requires 9 billion ethiopian birr to provide general and supplementary food, non-food items water and sanitation services and other essential.
human and natural made calamities, mainly conflict, flood, locust swarm, covid-19, among others, have been alternately ravaging the country causing endless humanitarian crisis, to say the least. no sooner ethiopia has tried to tackle the locust swarm, flooding, covid-19 than hit by another wave of internal conflicts and violence in tigray, oromia, benishangul gumuz, southern regions claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands. millions of internally displaced people, vulnerable children, women, the elderly, people with disability and the wounded have left their home fleeing the conflict riven areas and other natural mishaps.
the national disaster risk management commission (ndrmc) report of september 2020 indicates that flood has also affected 1,095,358 people out of which 313, 179 people were displaced across the country. regarding covid-19 pandemic in ethiopia, it economic, social, health, education and political impact has continued affecting millions of peoples to say the least. added to all these, the recent conflict and violence have complicated the humanitarian response of the national society.

"the ethiopian human rights commission (ehrc) announced it has found that crimes against humanity was committed by individuals and groups who directly participated in the violence and security crisis that swept through oromia region following the death of musician hachalu hundessa on june 29th, 2020.
ehrc visited over 40 different localities in oromia region over the course of several days as part of its investigation into human rights abuses committed there between june 29 – july 2, 2020, findings of which were released on friday january 1, 2021.
in the 59 pages report, the findings state that attackers moving in groups used axes, knives, machetes, sticks and other weapons to kill and injure civilians in gruesome ways that involved beheadings and torture. altogether, 123 people died and more than 500 were injured in the carnage that also displaced thousands from their homes.
the findings show that the attacks meet the elements of a crime against humanity with large numbers of people, organized in groups, having selected their victims on the basis of their ethnicity or religion when conducting a widespread and systematic attack in several different areas over the three days.
the report also states, while it is understandable that security forces had the challenging task of restoring order in the face of such widespread violence, the proportionality of the force employed in some contexts is highly questionable. in some instances, security forces employed disproportionate force in their attempt to restore order amidst widespread violence and as a result, passersby, bystanders, young people, elderly people stepping in to mediate, and even police officers lost their lives from gunshot wounds despite having no participation in the unrest.
the commission in its report stated that finds that the attacks during the unrest and overall commission of the crime by individuals and groups who directly took part in it, constitutes the elements of a crime against humanity. “more specifically, a large number of people, organized in groups for the most part, moved from place to place to kill, bodily and mentally injure and displace people; destroy property; the conduct was committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against civilian population that extended to at least 40 different localities and over three days from the early hours of june 30th to july 2nd , 2020; some targets in the attacks were selected on the basis of ethnic and religious identity. other civilians were attacked with intent regardless of their religious or ethnic affiliation; and the perpetrators knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population,” reads the report.
“on the basis of the above findings, the overall conduct carried out by the attackers who were organized in groups, and the result thereof, is not a simple criminal act but a crime against humanity which is an atrocity crime and a grave violation of human rights,” reads the finding.
the report further states that in the 40 localities where the commission’s investigation took place, following news of musician hachalu hundessa’s death, a large number of people went out into the streets, initially in the form of protest. after an act of burning tires, throwing stones and closing off streets, groups went on to attack people and destroy property in a conduct that took up pace beginning june 30th. 
“in localities where protesters who went out into streets caused unrest and attacks, civilians were attacked inside their homes by individual and grouped perpetrators and were beaten and killed in streets in a gruesome and cruel manner with sticks, knives, axes, sharp iron bars, stones and electric cables. people have also suffered mental and bodily harm; their houses and property were either looted or intentionally burned. people were displaced as a result and both private and public property was destroyed,” the report states.
“while the conduct varied from place to place in scale a   nd nature, the attack targeted people of amhara ethnic origin in localities where christians constitute the majority of the local population and, inversely, orthodox christians where muslims are a majority,” further reads the report.
the report also blamed security forces saying that the role of the security forces in preventing and stopping the attack on people and property also varied from place to place. “in some of the localities, security forces had appropriate preparedness and successfully managed to prevent, stop or minimize damage. on the contrary, where the security forces had minimal preparedness, such as in batu, shashemene, chiro, haromaya, woliso, adama, goba, arsi negele and arsi robe in particular, as well as dera, adaba, agarfa, kofele, djadju and iteya, the damage was extensive,” states the report.
“ehrc found that the localities where the devastation was massive, local authorities and security did not respond to victims’ repeated calls for help, being told instead “that higher ups gave no order to intervene, we are not here to protect private property, we are here to provide security to government development institutions, banks and religious institutions”. survivors and witnesses also recount how sometimes police stood watching as the attacks took place. “it did not feel like we had a government!” decried one victim the commission spoke to. local authorities, security forces and government officials on their part say that the widespread nature of the attacks and the large group of people taking part in them, made it difficult to stop the attacks with sufficient speed and scale. however, the lack of preparedness on the part of the regional government to prevent such attacks, including in those localities where similar attacks have taken place before, has exposed people to a repetitive cycle of abuses and violations,” reads the finding.
the report also states that there was disruption of medical services. “in some of the localities where ehrc’s investigation was carried out, witnesses describe being barred and prevented from accessing medical services. in guna woreda, negele city, arsi negele and dodola, in total violation of human rights obligations, security forces even went inside medical institutions and harassed, including by threatening medical professionals, and barred victims from getting medical help. flouting their humanitarian and professional obligations, some medical professionals themselves, in wolisso in particular, refused to treat victims of the attacks,” the report states.
the report recommended to start the process of investigating and bringing to justice and hold perpetrators accountable based on the commission’s findings of crimes against humanity.
ehrc’s chief commissioner daniel bekele said, “given the repeated pattern of atrocity crimes in the country, ethiopia needs to design and implement a comprehensive national strategy for the prevention of atrocity crimes which aims to address the root causes of the problem”."
"there is no greater feeling than the ‘come together feeling’ of the holiday season. the ethiopian christmas itself presents this great and joyous warm feeling and is popularly referred to as genna in amharic. genna over the years has always been a pinnacle of vibrancy but this season the lights have dimmed down as a result of the pandemic.
amongst the festivity, christmas is a year where stores, homes and streets alike are filed with decorations. similarly, during genna boutiques are often spotted displaying red cloths, christmas lights are lit as well as huge christmas trees decorated in the corners or entrances of malls. the ethiopian christmas is often quite unique from the rest of the world as it is always welcomed by a 43 day fasting prior. although the fast has been smooth thus far, the holiday market seems to have become a bit slower and much quieter, a shadow of what it once was.
genna is often embraced with joy and celebrated in groups of friends and family by eating an array of scrumptious ethiopian delicacies such as ‘doro wot’ (ethiopian national chicken dish), lamb stew and mouthwatering beef stews accompanied with injera and traditional drinks. however, a myriad of challenges stemming from the pandemic effect/ burden, current situation of the country, slow economy have become a negative contributor for the slow season as ‘business becomes very slow.’ slow season is a common complaint shared by both parties’ between the consumers and the buyers. the capital in previous years was graced by the presence of cattle, chicken and eggs amongst a flurry of activities in different streets but that seems to have fizzled.
muktar, who owns boutiques at megenagna recalls previous gennas as seasons where the streets were full of activities filled with high purchasing power by the consumers. “at christmas time, we usually sell kids cloths at a rapid pace. similarly, cloths for other ages are also high. this time round there is low demand despite having clothing products,” muktar noted as he expressed how much the degree has killed the pockets of the consumers.
beside the boutique business, the cattle market in the capital has become low unlike recent seasons where cattle would have been sold out within the first two weeks before the holiday.
during the holidays, it is always fun to visit holiday expos at the addis ababa exhibition center, which is buzzing with exciting crowd, music and food. however, the shopping experience might be less fun this time round. this comes after the restriction to public gathering and closure of bazaars and expos following the pandemic outbreak. after a yearlong break, the last week of december served exhibitions at exhibitions at different places of the capital. the prices are comparatively lower to the normal market and as result people flock in numbers to save their coin whilst having a great experience. trade fairs have been difficult to take part across the country owing to the insecurity challenges and the pandemic. the genna expo that was recently launched showed low turnout. the vendors lamented of the low turnout as opposed to other years as well as reluctance to purchase items. the expos are still on going at the ghion hotel.
as expected, the holiday market also reflected a slower movement of things as well as not so cheap goods. food items a household necessity during the holidays. these food items can range from groceries to live chicken, eggs, sheep and butter.
traders in the capital, source their butter, eggs and chicken from various parts of the country mainly from harer, gojjam, arbaminch and jimma. in most markets across addis ababa, the price tag for eggs currently ranges from birr 5.50 to 6 birr. the price of eggs has remained stable at the turn of the new year, despite low supply and demand as opposed to the previous trading of egg and chicken products in previous years.
similarly, household items such as a kilo of butter ranged from 320 birr to 350 birr with not much increase projected than last year’s price.
a kilo of onions is priced at a price range of 13 birr to 16 birr which is almost similar compared to the price last year as well as during the past three holidays.
like the onion market, a similar trend was also observed in the capital’s biggest cattle markets, kera. kera, one of the largest cattle market is waiting for the last days to in expectance for the market to rocket in sales. the supply of cattle comes from far and wide from the likes of harer, wellega, bahirdar, jimma, gonder and wolayita mostly used for the celebration. though the country has been battling the pandemic and the recent conflict the price has stagnated.
for cattle acquired from harer is said to cost 20,000 birr and that of wellega ranges between 20,000 birr to 30,000 birr whilst bahirdar 25,000-40,000 and cattle from wolayta costs the least price ranging between 15,000-20,000 birr.
fitsum, a cattle trader at kera, says the market may show increase of 1500 to 2000 birr in respective prices at the last or peak final days of the holiday but not much increase will be expected when compared with last year. this is attributed by a decline in supply of the cattle related with the political unrest of the country.
during holidays it is a common scene to see herds of cattle, flocks sheep and goats that are to be consumed for the holiday along with men carrying live chickens in neighborhoods.
during the days leading up to genna, a small sized sheep will easily sell for 3,000 birr with a midsized sheep costing 4,000 and above. the delight of having a sheep continues to be out of reach for many during the holiday and those who cannot afford to spend 3,000 birr will simply buy beef from the butchery to make a special meal.
chicken, is another holiday favorite and is what many resort to, and for this holiday live birds were selling between 250 and 300 birr. as most people prefer to buy live chickens for religious and freshness reasons, processed frozen supermarket chickens still remain cheaper.
it’s not all about meat alone, vegetables remain as important during the holiday as well. although not a lot of change has been seen with vegetables lately, some items such as garlic which skyrocketed around two years ago, hasn’t shown any difference. garlic is sold for 60 birr per kilo; red onions which are extremely important for most holiday meals are sold for 16 birr per kilo, an improvement from last holiday when they sold for 18 birr per kilo. tomatoes are going for 10 birr per kilo, while carrots are 8 birr and potatoes are 7 birr.
the above prices are usually found in open markets, prices at smaller fruit and vegetable kiosks around the city will be higher. as always, in some markets, shoppers will be able to get discounts if they are buying in bulk. other shops such as fresh corner also provide discounts on seasonal produce and are worth checking out.
although it is said the day before a holiday is the best time to by sheep and chicken, vendors usually get anxious to get rid of their stock and go home, there have been times that this has not been the case.
optimistically, the slowing of everything will soon change and with a new kind of spirit in the air that seems to be felt, many are hopeful that things will pick up again.
the central statistics agency’s monthly inflation data showed that the total inflation recorded in december 2020 was 19.5 percent higher than the same month last year.
also according to the central statistical agency december showed a slight decline in grain prices.
inflation compared to the same month last year shows current inflation, of which food inflation rose by 22.7 percent in december 2020. most cereals (especially rice) this month, teff, wheat, maize, barley and sorghum prices decreased slightly over the previous month. but meat prices continue to rise. some foods, especially tomatoes, onions, garlic, cabbage, carrots, butter, cooking oil, and cheese and eggs, have also declined. however, inflation in the same month last year was relatively low compared to the same month last year.
on the other hand, the inflation of non-food items index increased by 15.8 percent compared to the same month last year. over the past few months, inflation in non-food items has been steadily rising. inflation of non-food items in the index is one of the main reasons for the increase over the same period last year, especially in clothing and footwear, rent, home care and energy, furniture and home furnishings, home furnishings, medical and transport, especially in cars. it is an increase in prices. overall inflation in december 2020 showed an increase of 0.6 percent compared to the previous month."
"development bank of ethiopia has floated the first auction to sell the giant ayka addis textile after it was decided to be managed by the development bank. the banking system has also stated that the once giant company will come back to operation in short period of time.
in total the turkish company which was floated on auction for the sixth time, had failed to repay its loan from the bank and as a result it has also failed to attract bidders. an integrated textile factory building, machineries, equipment & furniture, vehicles, auxiliary tools, various spare parts, raw materials/ inputs, work-in progress, finished products /fabrics, and some other related items are set to be auctioned with close to 1.82 billion birr with negotiation.
as officials form development bank said, the bank took over the factory coercionary. however, the process of making the factory operational is finished and will be operational in short period of time. the officials explained that administering the factory to make it operational will help the factory to attract buyers. therefore, the group a once projected thriving textile company that became bankrupt is set to make a comeback.
as from the last fiscal year, the state-owned bank had ratified the annual budget to manage some companies that failed to attract buyers, including ayka addis.
apart from ayka addis, dbe also is in attempts to the auction four companies in total that failed to repay their loan from the bank. the four companies which significantly the state policy bank seeks billions of birr from are: ayka addis textile group, omo valley corporation, alsi addis industrial group and angeles cotton and textile production. the four companies were put up for sale by the dbe for failing to pay their debts.
the company, ayka addis textile and investment group was established in may 2012 with a total capital of 1 billion and a paid up capital of 679 million birr by turkish investment groups. the factory has been out of business for more than a year and has been paying its 4500 staff for free work due to lack of operation.
due to the inability of the company to repay the 3.2 billion birr loan that was provided by the development bank of ethiopia, the development bank had made attempts to auction it. the loan was provided at the onset of 2008 with the expected loan repayment time provided till 2013, which of course was unsuccessful.
ayka addis textile & investment group is the first company to be auctioned, and it failed to attract bidders who can offer 1.8 billion birr. the company failed to attract bidders primarily because of the high price set by the development bank as well as its competitiveness with regards to its marketing.
ayka addis textile factory is located on a 20.1 hectares piece of land with 4,500 workers and it is said to have the capacity to employ more than 10,000 workers.
ayka addis was once considered to be an anchor investment that ethiopia succeeded to attract. however, it did not take long for the company to face the dreadful realities of shortages in raw materials mostly cotton, lack of skilled labor and power outages. the political crisis also contributed to the malfunctioning of ayka addis. at first, ayka addis seemed to be doing well but failed to sustain the momentum and since 2014, it was operating on a loss until it declared bankruptcy in 2017. the company is believed to have created 7,000 jobs at the time.
a month ago, officials from the ministry of trade and industry, officials from the development bank of ethiopia and the confederation of trade unions visited the factory to discuss issues that will enable it to start operations soon.
“in the future, short, medium and long term plans will be prepared and the workers will be able to return to work and the factory will be operational in a short period of time,” stated melaku alebel, minister of trade and industry."
"public infrastructure developers’ call for national dialogue to come up with a common understating and accelerate upcoming investments, otherwise, it would be difficult to meet the public development demand.
on the urban development and construction standing committee meeting to hear federal integrated infrastructure development coordinating agency (fidca), almaw mengiste, head of fidca mentioned several mismatches regarding coordinated development, exaggerated and conflicting compensation rates from one area to other for similar assets, besides damaged on developed infrastructures and others that he said costs the country.
at the discussion, shiferaw telila, head of ethiopian electricity utility, representatives of ethio telecom, and habtamu tegegne, director general of ethiopian roads authority (era), and members of the standing committee expressed their concern on the damage and extraordinary compensation demanding behavior that they said it would make difficult to continue like that.
they said that the situation has become above and beyond the capacity of fidca, which is responsible to manage the coordinating development platform for roads, water and sewerage, electricity, and telecom infrastructures as per the establishment proclamation of 2014.
at the meeting held on wednesday, december 23 at parliament, ahmed shide, minister of finance, said that the situation is damaging the country’s resource since some of them are secured from foreign loans. he said that the situation would make the poor country poorer and is supposed to be corrected immediately.
he said that it is not about law and regulation, this needs commitment from all government apparatus for mutual understanding.
“the lower tiers of a government body is expected to support projects that come on their area than engaged with misdemeanor behavior and support for exaggerated compensation request and delayed the right off ways,” ahmed claimed.
but he appreciated some regions that are truly focused on developmental works than creating problems.
shiferaw said that lack of coordination costs the country huge amount of money including the foreign currency besides cutting services.
similarly, ethio telecom representatives have expressed their claim that their service is frequently interrupted because of other projects that are carried out on their infrastructure areas without their knowledge accompanied by theft.
the frustrated era head, habtamu, said that lack of commitment on lower tiers of the government body and regions has forced projects to be delayed. he insisted the government to suspend budgets and redirect for development work if they are not willing working amicably for projects that come to their area.
“it would be better if regional leaders were in this meeting. it is beyond the power and mandate of fidca that regions should seat down and discuss for common solution,” he said.
“i am wondering that there are massive infrastructure development demands in the country, but the situation in the reaction is very different when the government comes up with response,” he expressed his confusion on the situation at the ground.
“in the past there were claims that the farmers are not properly engaged on compensation, now i am afraid it is interpreted wrongly and on the reveres,” he added.
he said that development is coming for those specific areas but actual commitment and support from lower government official is very reluctant.
“for instance for project with 5km the compensation has become very high compared with the project cost,” he expressed his concern on the behavior of demanding inadequate and exaggerated compensation.
he said that the responsibility of lower government bodies, which are in charge to engage on identifying individuals for compensation, should be defined.
according to habtamu, in the past budget year alone era has paid more than four billion birr that he said based on the current behavior it would skyrocket up to nine billion birr, “how can we continue like this?” he asked.
he claimed that because of different challenges including delaying on right off way issue and compensation and access to natural resource like sand and quarry projects are delayed.
“we and contractors are accused for projects delay but one ought to identify details for the reason than blaming,” he added.
he mentioned several projects that have been suspended or delayed because of right off way and exaggerated compensation. era’s head suggests that the government should annul these kinds of projects and invest the resource on other areas for who really demand their areas improvement; otherwise it will be difficult to run like this.
“currently we have 300 active projects that now we are concerned how we finished them on integrated manner. national strategy should be emplacing to complete existed projects and elevate some illegal acts that sometime stand against the constitution and proclamations on accessing natural resources. we have to insure on enforcement of laws to accomplish projects,” he said and recommended regions to come for discussion to elevate challenges and accelerate the projected developments set in the coming ten year development plan besides the existed ongoing projects.
at the meeting, most of the participants appreciated inclusive discussion at national level for similar concusses to going on smooth manner.
ahmed of ministry of finance proposed the formation of technical taskforce at higher level to solve problems.
aisha mohammed, minister of urban development and construction, shared the idea of other leaders and said that regions are coming with public demand for development but when projects come to effect massive problems are created.
according to her, regarding law enforcement, the draft amendment of the proclamation has been tabled at the council of ministers.
she said the value estimation work should be undertaking by responsible entity, which should be formed for this purpose, than the trends that are seen in most of the regions, who conducted the estimation on temporary committee that is not viable to come up with accurate value estimation.
“uniform compensation price index is under drafting process,” aisha added.
finally she called for immediate discussion that includes regions on the aim to solve problems."

"ethio-telecom announced that all telecom lines to the mekelle core site in tigray have been severed.
according to frehiwot, the telecom infrastructure lines linking mekelle to wukro, ab’ala, abiyadi, maichew-kurkuftu, maichew-mehoni, as well as shire and shiraro have been cut.
footage has been released by ethio telecom depicting what looks like armed forces pushing themselves into the compound of the company’s office in mekelle, on november 4, 2020. in the footage, personnel of ethio telecom are forced out, and it further shows armed militia turning off the power distribution sources.
footage from the cctv, which was functional only until november 4, was shared by the ceo at a press conference on thursday december 10, at skylight hotel. the findings came after a physical examination of the core site following the federal government resuming control of mekelle, according to the ceo.
according to the ceo, a team of experts from ethio-telecom travelled to mekelle following the military’s control of the city. she noted that prior efforts to identify the causes of the total blackout of telecom services in tigray region since november 4 were futile as all means of verification failed to direct the experts towards successfully troubleshooting problems.
for instance, frehiwot explained, experts who travelled to mekelle managed to locate cuts 46 kilometers from wukro but they could not tell whether there are other places where the lines were severed further than that distance.
she added that this was done intentionally by perpetrators who wanted to disrupt the telecom services in the region to launch an attack on the northern command of the national defense forces located in tigray.
the ceo stated that the mekelle and shire core sites remain undamaged, except for the damaged lines connecting these sites to the base transceiver stations (bts) that supply end user networks.
after learning that the network had been disrupted in tigray through an automated sms notification at 12:37 am on the morning of november 4, 2020, she outlined experts and managers of ethio-telecom communicated and gathered at their hq at 03:07 am to troubleshoot and restore the services. but they could not access the mekelle core site as well as its employees who could have communicated to them through satellite phones at normal times, said frehiwot.
“experts at the core site would notify the national operation center whenever such problems happen,” she said.
it was in the subsequent messages from the government that ethio telecom learned of the war that broke out in tigray following an attack by the tigray special forces on the northern command.
she also revealed that within the first 14 days since the war broke out, 39.8 billion cyber-attacks were attempted on various government institutions and broadcast media houses.

"ethiopian human rights commission has sent an investigation group to konso in the southern nations, nationalities and peoples region (snnpr) to investigate the situation that occurred in the region regarding killing of civilians and human rights crisis.
daniel bekele commissioner of the ethiopian human rights commission confirmed to capital that the commission has sent an independent investigation group to the area to investigate the situation, “the team is doing its investigation work and monitoring all situations in the area,” said daniel.
starting from the last two week dozens of civilians have been killed with more than thousands of peoples being displaced. the number of people killed in the recent violence in konso reached 102 whilst 32 people sustained injuries and more than 83,131 people become internally displaced. the dispute is a result of clashes between segen woreda, karat woreda and kolme cluster areas of the southern nations, nationalities and people’s region, according to the konso zone government communication affairs bureau.
the head of the bureau said that the cause of the clash was a dispute between the petitioners who wanted to be a special woreda after the proclamation was repealed. the segen area people’s zone of the snnprs had underwent a restructuring in november 2018, after nearly four years of protest by the konso community, resulting in the split of the konso zone from segen area people’s zone, where konso wereda, along with derashe, amaro, and burji made up the segen area people zone since 2011.
escalation of ethnic motivated violence in ethiopia has resulted to deaths of dozens and thousands of displacement in different parts of the country. as ethnic tensions are rising in the country, the government is struggling to provide its citizens with safety and protection.
weeks-long attacks carried out by yet undisclosed, heavily armed militiamen in various localities of metekel zone, benishangul gumuz regional state, have also left unknown numbers of civilian causalities and destruction of properties.
also on sunday november 1st, armed soldiers in west of ethiopia opened fire and killed dozens of men, women and children in a cruel attack that was claimed to be executed by the oromo liberation army, a group that has been active in the area for a long period of time. the victims belonged to the amhara ethnic group.
the total number of deaths remains unknown; however, amnesty international stated that at least 54 people have been killed. the event took place in gawa qanqa village in guliso district of west wellega zone, reportedly a day after government forces withdrew from the region with no explanation.
as part of its investigation into human rights violations, preliminary findings of the commission has stated at least 600 civilians were killed in an ethnically-driven massacre earlier this month in the town of mai kadra in ethiopia’s tigray region.
similarly gunmen killed at least 34 people in a “horrific” bus attack in the benishangul-gumuz region of western ethiopia, the scene of recent deadly violence against civilians, the national human rights agency reported on sunday november 15.
on november 4, ethiopia launched an operation against tigray people’s liberation front (tplf), claiming the group has attacked troops stationed in the northernmost region of tigray.
as the commission described, ehrc is monitoring closely and is in consultation with the relevant authorities regarding the risk of multidimensional human rights violations arising from the ongoing war in tigray region.
in a statement, the ethiopian human rights commission (ehrc) called for humanitarian access to the region, as well as telecommunications to be restored and the resumption of health, water, electricity and other services.
urging the government to facilitate efforts to reconnect separated families and relocate and return displaced people and refugees, the body called on officials to allow access to an “independent and transparent” investigation into possible “grave human rights violations.”
after three weeks of intense fighting prime minister abiy ahmed declared that the third and final phase of the operation was largely over."
"after three weeks of military offense in tigray region to enforce law and bring in the so called criminal group of tigray peoples liberation front /tplf/ leaders on the evening of saturday, november 28 government has said, “the third and final phase of the battle came to an end.”
on monday, november 30, a day after announcing the end of military operations in the northern part of the country prime minister abiy ahmed told parliament, “the victory is ethiopia’s, truth has won and the prayers and tears of ethiopian mothers have-not gone in vain.” the prime minister also emphasized that people need to be humble and should not celebrate the win because the major battle is in front us, ‘poverty’, which must also be tackled.
also to foreign countries the prime minister emphasized through saying, “we don’t want to look like others. we want to look like ourselves. if you want to be friends with us, please understand us first. we have many years of experience, even more than most countries. we may be poor but we are not a country that will negotiate our sovereignty. threatening ethiopia for coins will not work.”
as prime minister abiy said that national forces did not kill any civilians in tigray, in what could be the latest accusation of mass murder on the part of tplf fighters, ethiopian national defence forces (endf) avoided civilian installations, including towns.
“why would we strike mekele? mekele is ours. it’s ethiopia’s. endf operate with utmost discipline and care for civilians,” the prime minister said.
the tplf had already been accused of a massacre of civilians after amnesty international and the ethiopian human rights commission separately said unarmed civilians were killed in the tigray town of mai kadra.
“there is no way to explain the mai kadra massacre perpetrated by tplf. it is the epitome of moral degeneration,” abiy said.
he told the audience that the endf opted not to destroy all tanks owned by the tplf because they had stationed them in civilian quarters, endangering life.
the fact that we didn’t sit down with the criminals for dialogue doesn’t mean we weren’t interested in dialogue. “we love to discuss, we hate wars. we begged, we are known for peace,” he said, ethiopia has one government, a government that respects the law, and can be asked according to the law, even in the time of the war we were having dialogues but it was with the legal interim government lead by mulu nega,” he added.
the tplf once ruled ethiopia for three decades, mostly as part of a coalition known as the ethiopian people’s revolutionary democratic front (eprdf). when abiy came to power in 2018, he sought to dismantle their grasp on power.
in parliament, he said the tplf wanted to manipulate everything in their favour and went as far as pretending to be on his side.
“the impression that tplf left when eprdf decided to merge is a false narrative,” abiy said referring to the merger of eprdf parties into the prosperity party last december.
“tplf itself endorsed the merger. tplf itself had also voted for the decision to adopt the algiers decision and forge peace with eritrea. but they went public to say they didn’t,” abiy explained. "
"efforts to rebuild the economies of the world’s poorest nations post-pandemic will fall significantly short unless their productive capacities are drastically improved, according to unctad’s least developed countries report 2020.
least developed countries (ldcs) with the most developed productive capacities have best been able to combat the fallout from the pandemic, according to the report. productive capacities are the productive resources, entrepreneurial capabilities and production linkages that together determine the capacity of a country to produce goods and services, and enable it to grow and develop.
“the pandemic has brutally reminded us of the urgent need to develop productive capacities in ldcs to enable them achieve structural transformation, reduce exposure to external shocks and build resilience,” unctad secretary-general mukhisa kituyi said.
he said the development of productive capacities in most ldcs has been too slow for them to overcome major development challenges and shocks such as covid-19. unctad’s productive capacities index (pci) shows that the majority of ldcs have low productive capacities: their average pci level was 40% below that of other (non-ldc) developing countries between 2011 and 2018.
worst economic performance in 30 years
the report says the covid-19 pandemic has hit ldcs very hard because collectively they are the world’s most vulnerable economies. this is aggravated by their very weak levels of resilience. they have the least financial and institutional means to react to external shocks such as the ongoing pandemic.
an estimated 1.06 billion people live in the 47 ldcs. despite their large demographic weight, ldcs account for less than 1.3% of global gdp. in 2019, the average gdp per capita in ldcs was only $1,088, compared with a world average of $11,371.
the report forecasts that the pandemic will push ldcs to their worst economic performance in 30 years in 2020, with falling income levels, widespread employment losses and widening fiscal deficits. the crisis will reverse years of painstaking progress by ldcs in social fields such as poverty reduction, nutrition and education, the report warns. the number of people living in absolute poverty in ldcs could rise by 32 million in 2020, pushing the poverty rate from 32.5% to 35.7% and limiting these countries’ chances of achieving the un’s sustainable development goals (sdgs). the people living in extreme poverty in ldcs account for more than 50% of the global population living below $1.90 per day and 34% of those living on less than $3.20 daily.
how to build productive capacities in ldcs
“bold policies to strengthen productive capacities in ldcs should constitute a key pillar of any sustainable recovery from the pandemic and long-term development strategy,” said paul akiwumi, unctad’s director for africa and least developed countries. such policies should go beyond cushioning people in ldcs from the impact of the pandemic. “they should spur an investment push to redress longstanding infrastructural gaps and support broader employment creation,” akiwumi added.
the report says countries that have lowered their economic vulnerability levels improved either their trade or production indicators, both of which are outcomes of better productive capacities, and help to drive a process of structural transformation.
structural transformation is the process through which a country’s productive resources such as natural resources, land, capital labour and know-how move from low-productivity to high-productivity economic activities.
some asian ldcs such as bangladesh, cambodia, laos, myanmar and nepal have made greater strides, experienced industrial growth and expanded modern service sectors, leading to strong gains in labour productivity.
by contrast, structural transformation has been slower in african, island ldcs and haiti, where agriculture and traditional service sectors generate most employment and output, and low productivity levels and growth continue to constrain living standards.
digital revolution for productive capacities
the digital revolution has raised hopes of ldcs leapfrogging – adopting modern systems without going through intermediary steps – but firms in these countries are severely disadvantaged.
“digital transformation requires technological capability, the acquisition of which takes time, is difficult and costly to acquire. it is accumulated through production experience during previous industrial revolutions, which have bypassed most ldcs” the report says.
in ldcs, the uptake of advanced technologies is still incipient and hindered by factors such as infrastructure gaps and skills shortages. policymakers are faced with the task of transforming predictions on the positive impacts of frontier technologies for ldcs into problem-solving strategies to promote firm-level innovation. but ldcs can only leverage the digital revolution in the productive sphere if they put in place industrial policies that reinforce and develop the technological capabilities of producers in all sectors, the report says.
an example of active industrial policy is uganda’s government-initiated kayoola bus initiative, which has established the domestic production of buses powered mainly by renewable energy to tackle the environmental and health problems of transport-related air pollution.
world should not leave ldcs behind
the report calls on the international community to support ldcs’ efforts with adequate financial resources, allow them enough policy space for them do design and implement their own policy choices, and adopt more effective international support measures, notably in technology transfer."
"new report by the african child policy forum (acpf) on africa and women suggests african countries to create girl-friendly nations through sustainable political commitment reflected in coordinated action that brings together enabling comprehensive legal and policy frameworks, adequate budgeting, and effective implementation.
ensuring the wellbeing of all girls, particularly the most vulnerable, requires strong commitment and coordinated action to address these systematic barriers since it is evident that girls in africa face intertwined legal, social, economic, cultural, attitudinal and administrative challenges that hinder the enjoyment of their rights. african girls are being robbed of their future and condemned to a lifetime of discrimination and inequality, according to an alarming report which ranks 52 african countries according to how ‘girl-friendly’ they are.“to be a girl in africa frequently means being denied education; getting married too young; enduring sexual, physical and emotional abuse at home, work and school; being barred from owning and inheriting property; and being last in the queue when it comes to state spending on health and covid 19 make things worse,” says the authors.
“african girls have endured harmful cultural beliefs, patriarchal gender attitudes and discriminatory laws, policies and practices for far too long,” said dr. joan nyanyuki, acpf’s executive director.
the report finds that girls living in africa today are more likely to be victims of trafficking, sexual abuse and labor exploitation; more likely to get married much younger and experience fgm than girls anywhere else; discriminated against by laws relating to marriage and inheritance; and likely to be poorer than boys.
in addition, they are at higher risk of mental health problems; more likely to be excluded from healthcare; and denied a decent education and more likely to drop out of school.
acpf’s unique girl-friendliness index (gfi) shows that african governments are increasingly becoming more girl-friendly and that some african governments take girls’ rights and well being seriously but many do not.
the gfi rates mauritius as the most girl-friendly country in africa, with tunisia, south africa, seychelles, algeria, cape verde and namibia also in the top category. bottom of the table comes south sudan, with chad, eritrea, democratic republic of congo, niger, central african republic and comoros all rated as least child-friendly and ethiopia ranked 40th from 52 africa countries on how friendly they are to women and girls.
“without determined and targeted action, african girls will be left behind as we step up efforts to achieve africa’s agenda 2063 and most specifically africa’s agenda for children 2040,” said dr. joan nyanyuki.“this important report acknowledges the progress made by some african governments towards protecting and promoting girls’ rights and wellbeing, but it also shows that much more needs to be done, especially in this time of the covid-19 pandemic,” she expounded.
the report calls for action in ten priority areas including develop girl-friendly laws and policies and repeal discriminatory provisions, withdraw reservations to regional and international treaties on the rights of girls, invest in girls’ education at all levels, invest in girls’ health and nutrition. to achieve the desired results, these actions need to be undertaken with the active involvement of relevant stakeholders including the private sector, civil society organizations and girls themselves."
"the 2020 ibrahim index of african governance (iiag) launched by the mo ibrahim foundation, highlights a decline in african governance performance for the first time since 2010.
the 2019 african average score for overall governance falls by -0.2 points below that of 2018, registering the first year-on-year score deterioration since 2010. this recent decline is triggered by worsening performance in three of the four iiag categories: participation, rights & inclusion, security & rule of law and human development.
in fact, progress had already been slowing down since 2015. over 2015-2019, performance slackened in both human development and foundations for economic opportunity, while deterioration continued in both security & rule of law and participation, rights & inclusion, even worsening for the latter.
however, over the decade, overall governance performance has slightly progressed, and in 2019, 61.2% of africa’s population lives in a country where overall governance is better than in 2010.
the 2020 iiag is the most comprehensive assessment of governance performance in 54 african countries. it tracks africa’s trajectory across four main categories: security & rule of law; participation, rights & inclusion; foundations for economic opportunity; and human development. the new iiag incorporates three significant upgrades: an expanded governance scope, including new areas such as environment and equality; strengthened indicators, thanks to better data availability; and a new section fully dedicated to africa’s citizens’ voices.
progress achieved over the last decade has mainly been driven by improvements in economic opportunities and human development. foundations for economic opportunity (+4.1) and human development (+3.0) have made good progress, primarily led by improvements in the sub-categories infrastructure and health, complemented by advances in sustainable environment.
this is threatened, however, by an increasingly precarious security situation and concerning erosion in rights as well as civic and democratic space. over the last decade, both participation, rights & inclusion (-1.4) and security & rule of law (-0.7) have registered worrying declines.
over the past decade, 20 countries, home to 41.9% of africa’s population, while achieving progress in human development and foundations for economic opportunity, have at the same time declined in both security & rule of law and participation, rights & inclusion.
only eight countries manage to improve in all four categories over the decade: angola, chad, côte d’ivoire, ethiopia, madagascar, seychelles, sudan and togo.
the 2020 iiag provides a picture of the continent before it was hit by covid-19. in terms of participation, rights & inclusion, progress was slowing long before the pandemic, which only worsens the existing negative trajectory. conversely, economic opportunity was set on a positive course of sustained progress, and the impact of covid-19 is now threatening this hard-won achievement.
in 2019, new analysis of the citizens’ voices section in the iiag reveals that public perception of overall governance registers the lowest score over the decade, with the pace of deterioration nearly doubling within the last five years.
the strongest correlations of overall governance performances are found with the sub-categories rule of law & justice and inclusion & equality. the indicators showing the strongest relationships with high overall governance scores span all four iiag categories, underlining the importance of a balanced approach to governance. the growing imbalance between the various governance dimensions outlined above is likely to threaten overall governance performance."
"over the last two decades, ethiopia has registered fast economic growth which has led to significant national poverty reduction. however, there were significant differences in the pace and nature of poverty reduction across ethiopia’s regions, according to a new world bank group rural poverty assessment study.
the report entitled ethiopia regional poverty report – promoting equitable growth for all regions was prepared in partnership with the planning and development commission of ethiopia (pdc), and complements the national poverty assessment produced earlier this year. the study also aims to evaluate regional patterns and inequalities in non-monetary welfare, including health, education, ownership of consumer durables, and access to basic services such as electricity and water. furthermore, it discusses trends and allocation of public expenditure across regions, and examines how allocation of public funds affects regional variance in monetary and non-monetary welfare.
“this is a very important study as it seeks to create regional poverty profiles and help to better understand why some regions registered fast poverty reduction while others did not and why living standards across regions vary,” said ousmane dione, world bank country director for eritrea, ethiopia, south sudan and sudan. “identifying the key factors which contribute to fast and sustainable poverty reduction can provide useful insights on how to accelerate it for lagging regions,” he added.
according to the study, across ethiopia’s regions, poverty declined at a much faster pace in urban areas than in rural areas. inequality, measured by the gini coefficient, increased in almost all regions from 2011 to 2016 generally as a result of stronger growth for relatively better-off households. this inequality hampered overall progress in poverty reduction.
the report, which complements the country’s national poverty assessment, provides poverty profiles for each region and aims to shed some light on why some regions registered fast poverty reduction between 2011 and 2016, while others did not. although national poverty reduced from 30% to 24%, there were strong differences in the nature of poverty reduction in urban versus rural areas. nearly all 10 regions experienced strong poverty reduction in their urban areas, while only the somali and the southern nations, nationalities, and people’s regions saw significant reductions in rural poverty.
“poverty in urban areas fell from 26% in 2011 to 15% in 2016,” said arden finn, an economist in the world bank’s poverty and equity global practice, and co-author of the study. on the other hand, there was limited progress in rural areas, where poverty decreased from 30% to 26% over the same period.”
predominantly urban areas such as addis ababa, dire dawa and harari have better outcomes in general, according to the study. among the mainly rural regions, gambella fares better when it comes to indicators such as education and preventing child stunting, while tigray has better health indicators, including reductions in infant and under-five mortality, increased immunization and improved health facility delivery.
despite strong reduction in monetary poverty, the predominantly pastoral regions of afar and somali lag in non-monetary welfare. circumstances such as location, gender, and household wealth play a role in determining primary school completion rates, secondary school enrollment rates, and access to electricity. within each region, the location of households generally explains these differences.
“in order to accelerate poverty reduction and reduce inequalities more investment is needed in rural areas, especially in key areas such as agriculture, human capital and jobs,” said arden finn."
"the stop tb partnership (stbp) has released step up for tb 2020, a new report prepared with médecins sans frontières (msf), which reveals both progress and shortcomings in the alignment of national tuberculosis (tb) policies with the latest international recommendations. the report finds that significant policy gaps risk undermining progress in the fight against tb, one of the world’s leading infectious killers, a situation that is further exacerbated by the negative impact of the covid-19 pandemic on people affected by tb.
global efforts to end tb received a boost in 2018 during the united nations high-level meeting on tb, when world leaders agreed on a set of ambitious targets to be reached by 2022. however, progress on implementation of the 2018 un political declaration on tb has stalled and even rolled backwards in the context of covid-19. the new report calls on countries to urgently update their tb policies and recommendations as a crucial first step towards ensuring the funding, scale-up and implementation of comprehensive tb responses.
step up for tb 2020 examines the national policies of 37 countries with a high burden of tb, assessing the extent to which they align with world health organization (who) guidelines and international recommendations. with an estimated 7.7 million people developing tb each year, these 37 surveyed countries represent 77% of the global tb burden and 74% of the estimated burden of drug-resistant tb.
“earlier this year, the covid-19 pandemic hit the world with devastating impact, and governments around the world quickly adopted new policies and laws in response,” said dr. lucica ditiu, stbp executive director. “meanwhile, tb remains the top infectious disease killer, even though it is preventable and curable. to make matters worse, most countries still use outdated policies, practices, tools and treatment regimens. our survey, which is conducted regularly, shows improvements every year, but we have a long way to go. we all must ensure that every single person affected by tb is diagnosed and treated using the latest available international guidelines and tools.”
previously known as out of step, this fourth edition in the series covers a larger set of countries and additional policies and practices related to four key areas: diagnosis, treatment, prevention and medicines procurement.
on diagnosis, the report finds that many of the surveyed countries still have outdated testing policies that may lead to inadequate tb prevention and care. around 347,000 people who develop tb each year in the 37 surveyed countries have a form of the disease that is resistant to existing treatments. of them, only 1% can hope to access comprehensive universal drug sensitivity tests, as just six of the 37 countries (18%) have introduced the necessary policies.
tb is the most common cause of death among people living with hiv, more than 28 million of whom live in the 37 surveyed countries. but a mere 14% of those countries have put policies in place that allow for the use of lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay (lam) testing for tb, which has been internationally recommended since 2015. this leaves more than 17 million people living with hiv without access to a rapid, affordable and life-saving tb diagnostic tool.
there is, however, some positive news on diagnostics policies. countries made progress on certain key indicators since 2017 when the last report in this series was published. for example, 80% of surveyed countries—with more than 1.5 billion inhabitants—indicate that they are now able to use rapid molecular tb tests as the initial test for people with symptoms of tb, finally moving away microscopy. however, most countries do not seem to have implemented this policy at scale; this should be a priority.
alarmingly, when it comes to treatment, nearly 39% of countries are likely to still use injectable medicines to treat drug-resistant tb (dr-tb) among adults, having failed to update the relevant policies in line with the latest international guidance. stbp calls for an immediate halt to the use of tb treatment involving injectables; oral medicines should be used instead, as recommended by who since 2018."
"ethiopian human rights commission has sent an independent group to investigate the situation that unfolded on monday night at the town of mia-kadra in the western part of tigray.
in light of the situation, prime minister abiy ahmed has order the ethiopian defense force to a military engagemenet in the tigray region after the tplf was accused of attacking a military camp in the region with attempts to loot military asset. the tplf denies the attack and has accused abiy of concocting the story to justify deploying the military.
the so called law enforcement operation has lasted for more than ten days resulting to military offence and counter measures in the northern part of the country both in amhara and tigray regions.
the federal government has said the national air force is attacking major possible targets, however tplf has been saying that there have been no air strike in the region and later gave a contradicting statement accusing the federal government for air attacks and military operation in the region. on friday debretsion g/michael president of the tplf, on his statement said that the government had launched air strikes on mekelle, adigrat, alamata, and parts of the western tigray region and shiraro.
“the war is not complete, this is just the beginning, more than 10,000 members of the northern command and defense forces currently are under the control of the tigray national regional state,” said debretsion.
according to the state of emergency fact check, in the late hours of november 13, 2020, tplf had fired a rocket towards bahir dar and gondar cities. as a result, the airport areas have sustained damages.
also the tigray regional government has accused abiy’s government for cooperating with eritrea to attack tigray region and its people, however, the eritrean government has announced it as a false accusation.
a statement posted on the facebook page of the tigray government said it would win the “justified” war, and added that a fighter will not “negotiate with their enemies”.
on tuesday, tplf had announced that debretsion g/michael had sent a letter to all political & civic stake holders regarding the current affairs. on his statement, debretsion said problems cannot be solved through military means; also african union has the responsibility to bring all political and civic stack holders of the country in to an all inclusive and comprehensive dialogue.
on saturday, the upper house of parliament has decided to establish a new interim administration allowing the intercession of the federal government and abolishing the existing illegal regional government lead by debretsion. the interim administration will appoint officials, ensure the respect for rule of law, approve the region’s budget and facilitate the process of conducting elections.
with reports of increasing casualties, concern is rising for the protection of civilians against hostilities. civilians caught in the cross-fire, especially children, women, elders and the disabled, are of paramount importance to protect. humanitarian partners have asked federal and regional authorities to facilitate humanitarian access to reach people in need in areas under their respective control.
on monday, november 9, amhara regional state has announce a death toll of about 500 civilians in mai-kadra town in the south west zone of ethiopia’s tigray region where both tigray and amhara natives live.
as daniel bekele, head of ethiopia human right commission informed capital, the commission has sent a group of investigators to investigate the situation on mai-kadra. the commission will compose reports and information to ensure accountability by investigating and gathering evidence of human rights violations committed by any party involved in the conflict.
“one of the concerns of the commission is working to protect civilians and non-participants on the war, and the commission is working closely with different stakeholders to insure civilian protection,” he stated.
“in the current context of the ongoing conflict in the tigray region, it is important to ensure access to humanitarian assistance and basic services, especially for the safety and protection of civilians who are not involved in the conflict,” he added.
“therefore, the armed forces involved in the conflict have a responsibility to protect civilians,” says the commission.
furthermore, the commission has said that it is closely following the government’s crackdown on the conflict in various parts of the country and allegations of discrimination in some areas on the basis of ethnicity.
as the regional government states the mass killing was ethnic based where hundreds of amhara peoples where selected to death. as of thursday november 12, amnesty international in its report confirms that scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in mai-kadra.
the organization’s crisis evidence lab has examined and digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers. it confirmed the images were recent and using satellite imagery, and geo-located them to mai-kadra in western tigray state.
“we have confirmed the massacre of a very large number of civilians, who appear to have been day laborers who in no way are involved in the ongoing military offensive,” said deprose muchena, amnesty international’s director for east and southern africa.
“this is a horrific tragedy whose true extent only time will tell as communication in tigray remains shut down,” he added.
the federal government has accused the tplf for the massacre in the town for killing civilians; however on friday tplf has denied the accusation and the amnesty report arguing the direct and indirect culprits is the fascist and the terrorist “abiy ahmed” who declared war on the people of tigray.
“the tplf is violating international child rights provisions and is barring even children from joining the special forces,” said the federal government.
moreover, the federal government is accusing tplf criminal gangs for setting up executive networks in addis ababa and other parts of the country to instill fear by caring out terrorist attacks.
the federal police have also announced that they have banned 14 private security agencies from operating illegally. according to the police commission, some private security agencies have recently been set up to carry out attacks on public and government institutions, as well as the recruitment and deployment of security forces, in defiance of their purpose. and the addis ababa police commission, in collaboration with other security forces, seized 163 firearms, 1194 rounds of ammunition and other assets during a three-day search operation.
on thursday, november 12, the house of federation has decided to lift up the immunity of 39 members of the house of federation from the 44 members, including debretsion, president of tplf. also the federal police commission has issued an arrest warrant on officials of tplf. the suspects are said to have been involved in armed robbery, by attacking the national defense and other related crimes. also seven military officers have been appeared to the court by betraying the nation and attacking the national defense force.
on friday november 13, the federal government has appointed mulu nega as the new administrator of the region, in addition, the chief administrator will recruit and appoint heads to lead executives- an organ of the regional state from political parties legally operating in the region.
tplf after its announcement of taking control of tekeze dam on sunday, on friday november 13 has claimed that the federal government has bombed tekeze dam, however the state of emergency task force has said the information is false and accused them to peddle falsehood for international audience.
the un and its partner organizations are committed to staying and delivering humanitarian assistance. a casted humanitarian response plan for tigray region is currently being finalized under the coordination of unocha.
according to unhcr sudan, at least 3,400 ethiopian asylum seekers have crossed the sudanese border through two border entry points in gedaref state since the 9th november. sudanese authorities are reportedly screened the asylum seekers for onward relocation to a reception center in shagrab camp in kassala state. 1,700 people have so far been screened and registered. no armed individual will be allowed to cross into sudan, according to authorities.
on friday, prime minister abiy has told members of the tigray special forces to surrender to the defense forces within the next three days.
a statement on saturday also confirmed that in the late hours of nov. 13, a rocket was fired towards bahir dar and gondar cities. as a result, the airport areas have sustained damages. details of the incident is currently under investigation."
"the government has announced that it will take decisive measure on those who may try to engage on trade sabotage in relation with the current situation in the country.
ministry of trade and industry (moti) has disclosed that a taskforce has been established in every region up to wereda level to control and evaluate the market activity.
eshete asfaw, state minister of moti, disclosed that every evening the regions are reporting their daily report on the overview of the market activity in every corner of the country.
he recalled that since covid 19 occurred in the country the government has been taking strong measures to stabilize the market. the government has taken different level of measures on more than 72,000 traders.
similarly, in the first quarter of the budget year, different administrational and other strong measures including revoking a license and filed cases to the court have been endowed on more than 13,000 illegal actors.
he said that in the latest development there is a trend on hording products mostly basic needs, ganging up for price increment by group and dropping productivity. “we have taken different measures on this acts and some of the matters have been solved amicably,” he told capital.
“in these regard there are water bottlers and other factories involved in underproduction and price increment on their production that is controlled by the government,” he remanded the latest attempt occurred in the market.
he added that in collaboration with illegal middlemen there were attempt to increase price on cereals that the government enabled to tackle.
different market sources including those that evaluate the situation at merkato, the biggest market center in the country, informed capital that due to the latest situation artificial price hike has been observed not only at the market places but at industries.
one of the sources that capital interviewed witnessed that since the government commenced offensive attack at the northern part of the country, that is, immediately after the tplf forces surprise attack on ethiopian defense force, some industries like food processing plants were found to deliberately slow down their daily sales and preferred to hoard the product at their warehouse.
“on one of the industry, who produce soybean products, that i know and located at lege tafo the company preferred to sale very limited amount of product on its daily basis,” one of the sources said.
he argued that the product has huge demand and there is scarcity in the market, while the company has huge stoke at its warehouse.
“besides slow downing the daily sales the company has increased its price in this past week without any reason,” he added.
some sources said that some are the traders may have relation with the illegal group of gangs that the government labeled as ‘junta’ under tplf.
eshete said that there are attempts to use the opportunity from some traders but the government is closely following the situation in every region and the capital.
“we are also taking measures on those who tried to abuse the circumstance for instance today (friday november 13) the addis ababa city have taken measures on those who tried to go illegally,” he added.
“we prefer to create awareness and now we do that but if anyone attempts to sabotage on the market the government will never forgive,” the state minister added."
"a once projected thriving textile company that became bankrupt is set to make a comeback. the company, ayka addis textile and investment group was established in may 2012 with a total capital of 1 billion and a paid up capital of 679 million birr by turkish investment groups. the factory has been out of business for more than a year and has been paying its 4500 staff for free work due to lack of operation.
according to melaku alebel, minister of trade and industry, the development bank of ethiopia is taking over the factory in accordance with the banking system.
due to the inability of the company to repay the 3.2 billion birr loan that was provided by the development bank of ethiopia, the development bank had made attempts to auction it. the loan was provided at the onset of 2008 with the expected loan repayment time provided till 2013, which of course was unsuccessful. ayka addis textile & investment group is the first company to be auctioned, and it failed to attract bidders who can offer 1.8 billion birr. the company failed to attract bidders primarily because of the high price set by the development bank as well as its competitiveness with regards to its marketing.
as from the last fiscal year, the state owned bank had ratified the annual budget to manage some companies that failed to attract buyers, including the turkish company, ayka addis group since there are thousands of employees under the company.
however as melaku said, the reason for this is the failure of the concerned parties to resolve their problems and the failure of the entire development bank of ethiopia to take responsibility for the factory.
“in the future, short, medium and long term plans will be prepared and the workers will be able to return to work and the factory will be operational in a short period of time,” he stated.
ayka addis textile factory is located on a 20.1 hectares piece of land with 4,500 workers and it is said to have the capacity to employ more than 10,000 workers.
on friday, officials from the ministry of trade and industry, including melaku alebel, officials from the development bank of ethiopia and the confederation of trade unions visited the factory to discuss issues that will enable it to start operations soon.
ayka addis was once considered to be an anchor investment that ethiopia succeeded to attract. however, it did not take long for the company to face the dreadful realities of shortages in raw materials mostly cotton, lack of skilled labor and power outages. the political crisis also contributed to the malfunctioning of ayka addis. at first, ayka addis seemed to be doing well but failed to sustain the momentum and since 2014, it was operating on a loss until it declared bankruptcy in 2017. the company is believed to have created 7,000 jobs at the time."
"hotspots in four countries on brink of faminea joint fao-wfp report raised the alarm on 20 countries including ethiopia, saying that acute food insecurity levels appear to be reaching new highs globally as a result of the socio-economic fallout of measures imposed to contain the spread of covid-19.
the report aims to raise an early warning on 20 countries and situations – called hotspots – that, starting from already significant levels of acute food insecurity in early 2020, are facing the risk of a further rapid deterioration over the next months.
hotspots in four countries – burkina faso, yemen, south sudan and nigeria – are on the brink of severe levels of food insecurity and could potentially fall into famine within three to six months as the coronavirus pandemic erodes people’s ability to access food the report warned.
the early warning analysis of acute food insecurity hotspots report conducted by the food and agriculture organization (fao) and the world food programme (wfp) found that millions of people who were already facing hunger are on the brink of famine as the pandemic plunders employment, disrupts agricultural activities, slashes remittances and sends crude prices spiralling.
“we are at a catastrophic turning point. once again, we face the risk of famine in four different parts of the world at the same time,” said margot van der velden, wfp director of emergencies.
burkina faso, yemen, nigeria and south sudan were already facing a dangerous combination of conflict, mass displacement, economic crisis and climate and agricultural calamity. covid-19 and subsequent restrictions and lockdowns that followed have only exacerbated the pain.
up to 80 percent of the people experiencing acute food insecurity are farmers, herders, fishers and foresters.
already in 2019, 135 million people were facing a food crisis or emergency in 55 countries and territories, while an additional 183 million were classified in stress conditions across 47 countries, with a risk of further deterioration.
how conflicts play out, whether humanitarian agencies have access to populations in need, what the pandemic does to food prices, and how governments deal with the currently burgeoning covid-19 pandemic will continue to affect food systems.
rainfall and harvest outcomes are also an important factor.
according to the 2020 global report on food crises – september 2020 update, the covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated these pre-existing and on-going drivers, mainly by causing economic activities to decline, which in turn led to income loss and reduced household purchasing power, and a multitude of food-system wide shocks.
in the next three to six months, 20 countries and situations shown on the map are likely to face potential spikes in high acute food insecurity, driven by multiple overlapping drivers, and require urgent attention. yemen, south sudan, northeastern nigeria and burkina faso have areas of extreme concern whose populations, partially or completely cut off from humanitarian assistance, have reached a critical hunger situation following years of conflict and other shocks.
in these areas, any further deterioration over the coming months could lead to a risk of famine."
"different governmental offices and divisions have started to set up police forces in order to provide protection against attack and vandalism following different political unrests in the country.in june 29, the assassination of the popular oromo singer, hachalu hundessa, in addis ababa triggered violence in many places of oromia region. hundreds were killed both by security forces and by civilian perpetrators moreover there was massive destruction of property, tourist attraction areas, investment areas and huge displacement had ensued after the incident.as reports indicate, the major victims in the society were women and children, tourist attraction areas in the region including hotels and lodges, and huge investment places.according to lelise neme, eic commissioner, the ethiopian investment commission (eic) is working on how to avoid similar vandalizing of investments by protesters.she indicated that in collaboration with the ministry of peace, the government is also working to establish an ‘investment police’.“by collaborating with ministry of peace we are working to establish a police force called as investment guards to protect investments,” she explained.similar to the commission, the ministry of culture and tourism is working to establish the ‘tourism police’ which is expected to be active in the current fiscal year. the ministry has disclosed that the force will be established in collaboration with the federal police commission to protect the tourist attraction sites, hotel and lodges as well as tourists from damages by individuals as a result of political unrest and protest.recent crimes against tourists and tourist destinations has continue to receive international attention. as a result, the travel industry has been placed in the position of allocating its scarce resources to convince tourists that it is safe to travel. the security issue has necessitated the tourism industry’s viewing of law enforcement agencies as a vital component within the industry.“as part of the women, children and youths, the ministry in its part is moving to establish a police force to protect women and children,” stated filsen abdullahi, minister of women, children and youth.“we are cooperating with regional and federal police to select specifically dedicated police forces to protect women and children,” added filsen. the minister also informed capital that the force would be trained domestically.according to the federal attorney general, attacking minorities in parts of the country observed that 160 people had lost their lives died whilst 360 people had sustained injuries as a result. in addition, 4.6-billion-birr worth of property was damaged as a result of the violence instigated in addis ababa and oromia.in response the government detained thousands, including prominent politicians it accuses of involvement in the violence. the security force presence in many towns in the region has increased since then.the federal attorney general said it has charged 2,000 individuals alleged to have participated in various ways in the protests and violence following the killing of, hachalu hundessa.some governmental officials claim that such kind of attacks are not indicative of the government’s limited capacity to protect citizens from attack. the officials claim that the fact that perpetrators have been brought to justice will deter future attempts of violence."
"global foreign direct investment (fdi) flows fell 49% in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019, due to the economic fallout from covid-19, reveals unctad’s latest global investment trends monitor released on 27 october.in the wake of the pandemic, lockdowns around the world slowed existing investment projects and the prospects of a deep recession led multinational enterprises to reassess new projects.“the fdi decline is more drastic than we expected, particularly in developed economies. developing economies weathered the storm relatively better for the first half of the year,” said james zhan, unctad’s investment and enterprise director. “the outlook remains highly uncertain.”according to the report, developed economies saw the biggest fall, with fdi reaching an estimated $98 billion in the six-month period – a decline of 75% compared to 2019.the trend was exacerbated by sharply negative inflows in european economies, mainly in the netherlands and switzerland. fdi flows to north america fell by 56% to $68 billion.meanwhile, the 16% decrease in fdi flows to developing economies was less than expected, due mainly to resilient investment in china. flows decreased by just 12% in asia but were 28% lower than in 2019 in africa and 25% lower in latin america and the caribbean.in the six months to june 2020, developing countries in asia accounted for more than half of global fdi. flows to economies in transition were down 81% due to a strong decline in the russian federation.the decline cut across all major forms of fdi, the report shows.the report shows that cross-border m&a values reached $319 billion in the first three quarters of 2020. the 21% decline in developed countries, which account for about 80% of global transactions, was checked by the continuation of m&a activity in digital industries.the value of greenfield investment project announcements – an indicator of future fdi trends – was $358 billion in the first eight months of 2020. developing economies saw a much bigger fall (-49%) than developed economies (-17%), reflecting their more limited capacity to roll out economic support packages.the number of announced cross-border project finance deals declined by 25%, with the biggest drops in the third quarter of 2020, suggesting that the slide is still accelerating."
"ethiopia has generated 500 million dollars in revenue from foreign direct investment (fdi) in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.according to lelise neme, eic commissioner, the commission has achieved 50 percent of its goal despite the numbers showing 20 percent decline in relations to the same period, the prior year.the percentage allocation of the revenue share include; agriculture sector shares which stood at 11 percent of the revenue, the service sector which was 47 percent, and the manufacturing sectors shares which came in at 42 percent of the total revenue.the 20 percent decline was as a result of the surge of the pandemic that has hit the globe hard. given the circumstances, the commissioner acknowledged that the amount generated this fiscal year is considered a success in its right.additionally, the country has earned 46.1 million dollars in revenue from exports in the industrial parks which accounts for 71 percent of the targeted 64.8 million dollars.lelise explained that in the last three months 44 projects had received implementation and an additional 36 projects had started their operation. according to lelise the highest investment registered is from china.regarding job creation outside of the industrial parks, 3795 job opportunities have been created and 10,864 jobs have been created within the industrial parks. a cumulative of 14,659 job opportunities has therefore been created in the last three month.apart from project implementation, the commissioner noted that the commission has been supporting investors and assessing the contributions of firms in terms of tax, employment, among others.lelise echoed that as part of the commission’s support it has streamlined itself with the government in preparing a recovery package that will help businesses that faced vandalization and property damage following the riots that ensued after the assassination of the famous oromo singer hachalu hundessa, on 29th of june.“associating with different relevant governmental sectors the commission is conducting a study on the damages that have paralyzed the businesses and the significant support mechanisms for the recovery processes of business are being undertaken,” said lelise.“when it comes to this kind of support, we have liaised with the ministry of finance which will officiate the details of the support to the businesses,” she said, indicating that the support includes import of vandalized machineries duty free, provision of loans from banks to the businesses and revision of existing loan repayment terms, among others.“a directive with full details of the support of the government to the businesses will soon be revealed by the ministry of finance. however, until the details are completed by the ministry the commission is working round the clock to give urgent support,” she added.societal awareness being one of the challenges that the commission faces, the commissioner has stated that the local community will be engaged on where the investment projects are located in cooperation with regional governments and investment offices.“the commission will also give priority to the local community in the working investment projects, so as to benefit the community directly,” she explained.speaking to reporters on monday, october 19, lelise stated that the government will no longer focus on building governmental industrial parks rather the focus will shift on attracting investors to build their own industrial parks. lelise expressed that the ongoing semera industrial park will be the last government-built park.but according to sandokan debebe, ceo of the industrial parks development corporation (ipdc), there is no such kind of direction set by the government.“the decision depends on the market and economic policy, for now there is no decision to stop building industry parks,” stated the ceo, adding that making sure the existing parks are fully operational remains as the target focus as opposed to building new parks.the ceo informed capital that the corporation is preparing a spatial plan to support coordination of the industrial park construction. the corporation is also targeting the completion of semera industrial park in the current fiscal year. the cooperation is also looking forward to the construction of adama huna industrial park which is being loan-financed by the china exim bank."
"save the children is calling on governments to mobilize at least one percent of their gdp to the ‘social protection scheme’ to protect children and end child poverty.
save the children stresses that now more than ever, countries need to make progress towards universal child benefits.
“investing in child benefits not only helps children and their families but also local and national economies, as families spend their money on local goods and services,” inger ashing, ceo of save the children stated.
according to the recent report of the organization, families of over 594 million children in the globe have not received any financial support from their governments to pass the dare of the pandemic.
as save the children echoed, these 594 million families are found in 68 low and middle income countries. these families have drowned in poverty ever since the start of the pandemic as they have lost their source of income. this as a results affects the children since the families have not received any governmental support. furthermore, an additional hundreds of millions of families are looking for aid to survive the surge of the pandemic which has widened the drift in income inequality with low income families being hit the hardest.
even before the outbreak, according to save the children, over 1 billion children in low- and middle-income countries lived in multidimensional poverty deprived of access to education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation, and water. since the coronavirus outbreak, this number has increased by an additional 150 million children, bringing the total to 1.2 billion.
“the impacts of covid-19 transgresses past health issues. we as a community need to play our part in protecting children from the impacts of this pandemic. any support we provide to children goes a long way towards improving the economy of the country as a whole,” stated azmeraw belay from save the children: ethiopia country office and head of crg, advocacy and campaign.
ekin ogutogullari, country director; save the children for ethiopia’s country office also remarked by saying, “everyone around the globe has been affected by this pandemic; children suffered its consequences more than others. children are at risk with each passing moment as their parents might lose their job, get sick or die due to covid-19.”
save the children disclosed that before the covid-19 outbreak only 35% of children globally received social protection benefits. this figure falls to 28% in asia and as little as 16% in africa.
save the children has called on governments, donors and private creditors and the global community at large to create a financial means to improve child focused social protection schemes and universal children benefits."
"covid-19, flooding and the locust outbreak are said to be creating a humanitarian crisis in ethiopia with many people unable to meet their daily food needs, according to the international rescue committee (irc).
“recent heavy rainfall has led to flooding, resulting in destruction of crops, loss of livestock and displacement. swarms of multiplying desert locusts have also been destroying pastures and crops, leading to further food insecurity. some areas are recording admissions for severe acute malnutrition at 50% higher than for the same period last year. a massive twelve fold increase in covid-19 cases between june and september is further compounding needs as families have been unable to obtain income or access food due to movement restrictions,” reads a statement from irc. ethiopia currently holds the highest covid-19 caseload in east africa.
the statement further said that irc is working to safeguard the lives of affected and at-risk communities from the covid-19 pandemic by raising community awareness on covid-19 risk factors, providing personal protective equipment, and building and installing water points to help people practice preventative methods. “the irc is assisting desert locust and flood-affected households with multi-purpose cash transfer and non-food items to fill food security gaps and provide relief,” the statement states.
“the multiple issues of flooding, locusts, intercommunal violence and covid-19 are highly concerning given the already massive humanitarian needs in the country. the slowdown of the economy and lockdown restrictions mean that people have not been able to access income and there is an upward pressure on food prices,” said frank mcmanus, irc ethiopia country director.
“over 19 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in ethiopia. at four times the number of people displaced in 2019, as a result of the flooding, more than 300,000 people have been displaced in 2020 and have had their homes and livelihoods lost or damaged. a total of over 1 million people have been adversely affected by the floods overall. with the spread of covid-19, people that have been displaced are amongst the most vulnerable due to the often congested living space, compromised health conditions, and inadequate access to basic services. the irc is providing essential support through distributions of non-food items, including emergency shelter, household goods, hygiene kits, and cash assistance to over 36,500 affected people.”
“despite the irc’s work, the unmet humanitarian needs are still great. with more funding for our work, we will be able to reach even more people with the critical support they so desperately need after losing their homes and livelihoods.”
ethiopia is one the poorest countries and has suffered decades of drought, intercommunal violence, disease outbreaks and flooding. whilst grappling with its own development and humanitarian needs, ethiopia is also a major host country for refugees in the region. in a highly complex humanitarian setting with seven million people who are acutely food insecure, irc is working to ramp up support to those most in need.
the irc has been working in ethiopia since 1999 implementing emergency and development work in rural communities and 21 refugee camps, reaching over 3.2 million clients through programs in environmental health, health, education, child protection, economic recovery and development, and women’s protection and empowerment in six regions across the country."
"critical funding gaps are halting and disrupting crucial mental health services in africa, as demand for these services rise amid the covid-19 pandemic, a new world health organization (who) survey shows.
the survey of 28 african countries was undertaken as part of the first global examination of the devastating impact of covid-19 on access to mental health services. it underscores the urgent need for increased funding. of the countries responding in the african region, 37% reported that their covid-19 mental health response plans are partially funded and a further 37% reported having no funds at all.
this comes as the covid-19 pandemic increases demand for mental health services.
“isolation, loss of income, the deaths of loved ones and a barrage of information on the dangers of this new virus can stir up stress levels and trigger mental health conditions or exacerbate existing ones,” said dr matshidiso moeti, who regional director for africa. “the covid-19 pandemic has shown, more than ever, how mental health is integral to health and well-being and must be an essential part of health services during outbreaks and emergencies.”
african countries account for 15 of the top 30 countries globally for suicide per 100 000 people. while there is scant data on how covid-19 is increasing mental health conditions on the african continent, one study in south africa found that 10-20% of the 220 people surveyed reported potent experiences of anxiety and fear as a result of the pandemic. another survey of 12 000 women in low-income communities in uganda and zambia found an increase in persistent stress, anxiety and depression.
the who assessment of mental health services took place in july and august 2020 and 27 of the 28 african nations which responded have included mental health in their covid-19 response plans, underscoring the growing recognition of the importance of this once neglected area of health.
in africa, substance use disorder services were the mental health services facing the biggest disruptions. the main causes for the disruptions were due to patients failing to turn up, travel restrictions hindering access to health facilities and a decrease in patient volume due to cancellations of elective care.
while at the global level, up to 70% of countries have responded to the challenges posed by covid-19 with telemedicine, in africa governments have set up counseling helplines and increased training for key health responders in basic psychosocial skills.
even before the pandemic, the region had one of the lowest mental health public expenditure rates, at less than us$ 10 cents per capita.
with increasing pressure on health systems and rising demand, stretched and chronically underfunded mental health services are under increasing strain.
“covid-19 is adding to a long-simmering mental health care crisis in africa. leaders must urgently invest in life-saving mental health care services,” said dr moeti.
“we also need more action to provide better mental health information and education, to boost and expand services, and to enhance social and financial protection for people with mental disorders, including laws to ensure human rights for everyone.”
the who regional office for africa has released guidance on managing covid-19 and mental health for health workers and the general public. who is assisting african governments in responding to the pandemic as fits their unique circumstances."
"an investigation by amnesty international has exposed horrifying new details about the treatment of ethiopian migrants detained in saudi arabia. since march, huthi authorities in yemen have expelled thousands of ethiopian migrant workers and their families to saudi arabia, where they are now being held in life-threatening conditions.
amnesty international interviewed detainees who described a catalogue of cruelties at the hands of saudi arabian authorities, including being chained together in pairs, forced to use their cell floors as toilets, and confined 24 hours a day in unbearably crowded cells. amnesty international documented the deaths of three adults in detention, based on consistent eyewitness testimonies. other detainees reported at least four more deaths; while it was not possible to independently corroborate these claims, the prevalence of disease and the lack of food, water and health care indicates the true number of deaths could be much higher.
“thousands of ethiopian migrants, who left their homes in search of a better life, have instead faced unimaginable cruelty at every turn. confined to filthy cells, surrounded by death and disease, the situation is so dire that at least two people have attempted to take their own lives,” said marie forestier, researcher and advisor on refugee and migrant rights at amnesty international.
“pregnant women, babies and small children are held in these same appalling conditions, and three detainees said they knew of children who had died. we are urging the saudi authorities to immediately release all arbitrarily detained migrants, and significantly improve detention conditions before more lives are lost.”
amnesty international is also calling on the ethiopian government to urgently facilitate the voluntary repatriation and reintegration of ethiopian nationals, and to press the saudi government to improve detention conditions in the interim.
amnesty international interviewed 12 detained ethiopian migrants via a messaging app between 24 june 2020 and 31 july 2020. their allegations were corroborated by videos, photos and satellite imagery analyzed by the organization’s crisis evidence lab."
"every year, an estimated $88.6 billion, equivalent to 3.7% of africa’s gdp, leaves the continent as illicit capital flight, according to unctad’s economic development in africa report 2020.illicit financial flows (iffs) are movements of money and assets across borders which are illegal in source, transfer or use, according to the report entitled “tackling illicit financial flows for sustainable development in africa.”it shows that these outflows are nearly as much as the combined total annual inflows of official development assistance, valued at $48 billion, and yearly foreign direct investment, pegged at $54 billion, received by african countries – the average for 2013 to 2015.“illicit financial flows rob africa and its people of their prospects, undermining transparency and accountability and eroding trust in african institutions,” said unctad secretary-general mukhisa kituyi.these outflows include illicit capital flight, tax and commercial practices like mis-invoicing of trade shipments and criminal activities such as illegal markets, corruption or theft.from 2000 to 2015, the total illicit capital flight from africa amounted to $836 billion. compared to africa’s total external debt stock of $770 billion in 2018, this makes africa a “net creditor to the world”, the report says.iffs related to the export of extractive commodities ($40 billion in 2015) are the largest component of illicit capital flight from africa. although estimates of iffs are large, they likely understate the problem and its impact.iffs undermine africa’s potential to achieve the sdgsiffs represent a major drain on capital and revenues in africa, undermining productive capacity and africa’s prospects for achieving the sustainable development goals (sdgs).for example, the report finds that, in african countries with high iffs, governments spend 25% less than countries with low iffs on health and 58% less on education. since women and girls often have less access to health and education, they suffer most from the negative fiscal effects of iffs.africa will not be able to bridge the large financing gap to achieve the sdgs, estimated at $200 billion per year, with existing government revenues and development assistance.the report finds that tackling capital flight and iffs represents a large potential source of capital to finance much-needed investments in, for example, infrastructure, education, health, and productive capacity.for example, in sierra leone, which has one of the highest under-five mortality rates on the continent (105 per 1,000 live births in 2018), curbing capital flight and investing a constant share of revenues in public health could save an additional 2,322 of the 258,000 children born in the country annually.in africa, iffs originate mainly from extractive industries and are therefore associated with poor environmental outcomes.the report shows that curbing illicit capital flight could generate enough capital by 2030 to finance almost 50% of the $2.4 trillion needed by sub-saharan african countries for climate change adaptation and mitigation. "
"covid-19 transmission in africa has been marked by relatively fewer infections, which have been on the decline over the past two months, owing to a variety of socio-ecological factors as well as early and strong public health measures taken by governments across the region, according to world health organization (who).
the pandemic has largely been in a younger age group and has been more pronounced in a few countries, suggesting country-specific aspects are driving the pattern of disease and death. about 91% of covid-19 infection in sub-saharan africa are among people below 60 years, and over 80% of cases are asymptomatic.
a mix of socio-ecological factors such as low population density and mobility, hot and humid climate, lower age group, interacting to accentuate their individual effects, are likely contributing to the pattern seen in africa.
since 20 july, the region has seen a steady decline in new covid-19 cases. over the past four weeks, 77 147 new cases were reported, down from 131 647 recorded in the previous four weeks.
some of the most-affected countries including algeria, cameroon, cote d’ivoire, ethiopia, ghana, kenya, madagascar, nigeria, senegal and south africa have all seen infections drop every week over the past two months. deaths attributed to covid-19 have also remained low in the region.
“the downward trend that we have seen in africa over the past two months is undoubtedly a positive development and speaks to the robust and decisive public health measures taken by governments across the region,” said dr matshidiso moeti, who regional director for africa. “but we must not become complacent. other regions of the world have experienced similar trends only to find that as social and public health measures are relaxed, cases start ramping up again.”
while governments have made efforts to improve covid-19 testing, with recent testing rising from a cumulative 74 tests per 10 000 people in 44 assessed countries on 23 august 2020 to 93 per 10 000 people on 21 september 2020, the level is still low.
nonetheless, the region’s statistics on testing have been useful for policy as they reflect the patterns of infection within a country, and the missed covid-19 cases are largely because they are asymptomatic. in addition, there is no evidence of miscalculation of death figures, which are more difficult to miss statistically.
“africa has not witnessed an exponential spread of covid-19 as many initially feared,” said dr moeti. “but the slower spread of infection in the region means we expect the pandemic to continue to smoulder for some time, with occasional flare-ups.”
in recent weeks, cameroon and cote d’ivoire which are among the countries that have recorded a decline in infections since mid-july, have seen a slight increase in cases. it is crucial that countries maintain public health measures that have helped curb the spread of covid-19 to limit further infections and deaths.
“the response in african countries needs to be tailored to each country’s situation moving forward as we see different patterns of infection even within a country. targeted and localized responses that are informed by what works best in a given region of a country will be most crucial as countries ease restrictions and open up their economies. blanket approaches to the region or countries are not feasible,” dr moeti said.
who continues to support countries to scale up public health response, particularly in high-risk locations."
"the bill & melinda gates foundation launched its fourth annual goalkeepers report, featuring new data showing how the ripple effects of covid-19 have stopped 20 years of progress toward the united nations sustainable development goals (global goals).
the report provides the most current global dataset for how the pandemic is affecting progress toward the global goals. it shows that by nearly every indicator, the world has regressed. because of covid-19, extreme poverty has increased by 7%. vaccine coverage, a good proxy measure for how health systems are functioning, is dropping to levels last seen in the 1990s, setting the world back about 25 years in 25 weeks.
economic damage from covid-19 is reinforcing inequalities. the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women, racial and ethnic minority communities, and people living in extreme poverty. around the world, women are facing an increased burden from rising demands in total unpaid care work and experiencing the majority of job losses. in the united states, the percentage of black and latinx people who say they cannot pay their rent is twice the percentage of white people.
despite the bleak projections, bill and melinda gates describe a path to ending the pandemic and resuming progress toward the global goals. in the report, which they co-author every year, they call on the world to collaborate on the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and treatment; manufacture tests and doses as quickly as possible; and deliver these tools equitably based on need rather than the ability to pay. there are currently several viable strategies to help achieve an equitable outcome, including the access to covid-19 tools (act) accelerator, the most serious collaborative effort to end the pandemic, which brings together proven organizations like gavi, the vaccine alliance and the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria.
“the response to the covid-19 pandemic has shown us some of the best of humanity: pathbreaking innovation, heroic acts by frontline workers, and ordinary people doing the best they can for their families, neighbors, and communities,” bill and melinda gates write. “this is a shared global crisis that demands a shared global response.”
the report makes clear that no single country will be able to meet this challenge alone. any attempts by one country to protect itself while neglecting others will only prolong the hardships caused by the pandemic. developing and manufacturing vaccines will not end the pandemic quickly unless they are delivered equitably.
according to modeling from northeastern university, if rich countries buy up the first 2 billion doses of vaccine instead of making sure they are distributed equitably, then almost twice as many people could die from covid-19.
the international monetary fund projects that, despite the us$18 trillion already spent to stimulate economies around the world, the global economy will lose us$12 trillion or more by the end of 2021-the biggest global gdp loss since the end of world war ii. in some countries, spending on emergency stimulus and social protection has prevented worse outcomes. but there are inherent limits to what low- and middle-income countries can do to safeguard their economies, regardless of how effectively those economies have been managed.
despite these constraints, countries are innovating to meet the challenges. more candidates for vaccines and therapeutics are being developed faster than ever. pandemic-focused innovations include contact tracing in vietnam and pooled testing in ghana, while new or improved digital cash transfer programs are reaching 1.1 billion people in 138 countries. the africa centres for disease control and prevention and dozens of partners launched the african medical supplies platform in june to ensure that countries on the continent have access to affordable, high-quality, lifesaving equipment and supplies, many of which are manufactured in africa."
"after a hard and challenging 12 months and additional 5 days of the thirteenth month ethiopians have started the new year with hope and optimism.
since the ethiopian calendar is based on the julian calendar ethiopian year consist of 12 months each 30 days and an additional thirteenth month of 5 or 6 days of timekeeping marks the new year approximately after the end of the rainy season, the beginning of the new year celebration of springtime and renewed life.
ever since the holidays came ethiopians have their own tradition to celebrate the festive. usually, preparation for the festive begins before one or two weeks, as shoppers begin their spree.
most of the time holiday market marks a rise in price and demand although a shortage in supply commodities. demand and supply are heavily influenced by consumer habits connected to religious practices and festivities. the new year market is also showing a slight increase in price. however, as most of the people suggests the price hick was starting from four and five months back.
the price of household commodities usually rises during the rainy season but the current price is unpredictable with many rushing to get their last-minute shopping done, some were feeling the burden of seasonal expenses, others exhausted.
food items price spike continues to be a headache to the majority of the population who were suffering from the income decline ever since the covid 19 pandemic.
ethiopian economy drop from the time when the first victim of corona virus was announced. according to the latest report from the central statistics agency inflation in the month of august has recorded a 20 percent rate by showing a 2.3 percent drop from the prior month which has been increasing for the last four months.
real gdp growth slowed to an estimated 7.4% in 2019 from 7.7% in 2018, caused by social unrest and fiscal consolidation to stabilize public debt.
in light of this, the covid-19 pandemic will have multiple channels through which it will impose a burden on the economy. the inflation mainly hurts low-income people living in urban areas subsequently in fear of the transmission of the virus most of business in the country has stayed closed which mainly millions of the urban population relay on.
even if inflation has risen with regards to both food and non-food items, however high shake over the price of vegetables, grains including teff and other necessities over the last few months have crashed the population. especially onions, garlic, tomatoes, red-pepper has shown a rapid increase in their price.
the cost of red onions increased from an average of 13 to 35 birr per kilogram depending on the place and the type. according to the holiday market in most places of the city, a kilogram of onion is being sold for 22 up to 35 birr. teff is sold within the range of 4,000 birr per quintal and red pepper is pricing 180-190 birr increasing from 75 birr per kilogram.
traders were selling an egg for 5.50 to 6.50 birr, whereas a chicken would set consumers back between 400 birr to 550 birr. most are also selling a kilo of butter from 250 birr to 320 birr and the market has shown a decrease in price than it was on eastern.
mostly butter, eggs, and chicken come to the city from various parts of the country.
kera, akaki, shegole, bercheko are the largest cattle markets receiving cattle from different parts of the country, mainly from harer, wellega, bahirdar, jimma, gonder and wolayita among others. usually, the sale of livestock inside the center reflects significant seasonal variations on demand and supply.
as most of the traders in kera cattle market traders agree the supply has shown a slight increase than it was before the price and the demand is declining.
although the ministry of trade and industry has been taking different measures still the price is spiking from day to day.
the ministry argues that even if there is a shortage of consumer goods due to the outbreak of the pandemic and the instability in some parts of the country, also traders are increasing price to benefit from the situation by pretending as there is a shortage of production. economic fall down has been caused by economic sabotage via traders.
the ministry also plan to alleviate the problem by controlling illicit trade, engaging more in import substitution and adequately supplying locally produced consumer products.
to control the price hike on food commodities the ministry is distributing the commodities through unions, including sugar, wheat, maize, rice, oil, and teff.
currently, unions are distributing 1.5 million quintals of teff to the market.
usually at a time of such kinds of big holidays it was familiar to see bazaars and exhibitions in most parts of the city however this year due to the pandemic and to avoid public gatherings such events where canceled  .    "
"the rainy season bring with it challenges to hydropower plants. lake weed commonly referred to as enboch, buoyant grass and lack of spare parts are resulting in power interruptions.
last week, ethiopian electric power had disclosed that awash 1 and 2 hydro power plants had stopped operations because of ‘enboch’ and high waters. apart from awash according to eep, tana beles hydro power plant is also facing the same fate.
according to the ethiopian electric power, the spread of water hyacinth which is commonly known as enboch on lake tana is also presenting a challenge to tana beles – the second largest hydro-electric power plant in the country with an installed capacity of 460 mw.
as the office disclosed the problem needs an immediate solution and if not properly tackled the hydro-electric plant would stop its operation. as a result of this, tana beles had been temporarily closed for three days from august 16-18.
“even if the power plant has taff boom-which is an equipment that offers protection during operation from buoyant grass, the increasing average of the grass is making the situation difficult.
beles hydroelectric power plant is located on lake tana which has been affected by ‘enboch’ for about ten years. beside the effect brought about the buoyant grass, enboch, is also adding more risk to the power plant. according to moges mekonnen, pr of ethiopian electric power, describes the situation as daunting. this is because when trials are made to control the spread of one side of the lake, the weed begins to sprout on the other end and their spread are propagated by wind and storm. 
as moges informed capital to control the spread and the effects on the plant there are activities such as leasing boats to prune the weed. however for sustainable solution he suggested that the activity should be strengthened in terms of the efforts made to control the spread.
the covid-19 pandemic has further added fuel to the fire since human labor was required to reduce the infestation of water hyacinth on lake tana.
starting from 2011 the lake has been affected by the infestation which is the most dangerous weed affecting lakes around the world.
this deep-rooted issue actually started in 2011, and infestation has continued its spread since. hyacinth is the most dangerous weed affecting lakes around the world to date.
on september 2019 the government formed an agency tasked with the protection and development of water resources to control the spread of the weed. three methods being used to control the spread of the weed are; using chemicals, using biological means, and lastly is removing it physically by using both machines and human resource. despite these efforts, the infestation has persisted and even got worse. 
the infestation still poses a serious threat to the lake, the surrounding community, and the nile basin.
enboch directly threatens both the lake and its inhabitants. it deprives aquatic plants and animals of sunlight and oxygen. it also restricts water flow and is an obstacle to all kinds of economic activities including fishing, navigation, power generation and irrigation."
"the state owned financial firm the development bank of ethiopia (dbe), in the past financial year, has successfully been able to double its loan collection capacity despite having a rocky past few years. this has resulted in a significant drop in the non-performing loan (npl) ratio.
in a webinar evaluation of the past financial year, dbe announced that it secured close to 7.4 billion birr revenue with 111% achievement.
haileyesus bekele, president of dbe, described the result as historical for the bank that was in crisis in the past years due to the growing of npl.
the bank’s revenue has also been boosted by 31 percent compared to the prior year’s performance.
in the 2019/20 financial year the policy bank has secured close to 1.3 billion birr gross profit before tax, while the net profit after tax stood at 1.13 billion birr. this is a first in the history for the bank to register a billion birr profit.
according to the report, the bank approved a loan of 10.4 billion birr with 76 percent of its target during the year. at the same time in the stated period it has disbursed 8.54 billion birr, which is 71 percent compared with the target set for the end year.
the bank has also collected 7.7 billion birr loan from clients in the past year that is 98 percent from its target during the fiscal year.
the loan collection is stated as a big result as it is badly required to reduce the npl. dbe’s npl had reached 40 percent about two years ago, while it has reduced it to 34 percent for the 2019/20 financial year.
“particularly, the bank’s annual loan collection almost doubled as compared to the previous year’s performance and its historical average performance,” the bank stated.
currently, the bank has a total loan portfolio of 55.67 billion birr, which is a 9 percent increase from the previous year’s amount of 51 billion birr. the npl’s ratio has also decreased by 4.6 percent in comparison to last year’s performance.
the bank also sold grand ethiopian renaissance dam bond which amounted to 616.43 million birr during the budget year.
haileyesus also echoed that these achievements would be replicated in the next year by reducing npl’s through collection of loans and aggressive participation in bond sales.
in 2020/21 fiscal year, the bank targets to approve 10.09 billion birr loan, disburse 10.03 billion birr and collect 8.24 billion birr as well as reduce the npl ratio to 25 percent.
in may this year the council of ministers approved to increase the authorized capital of the bank to 28.5 billion birr."
"the covid-19 global pandemic has continued to affect many sectors of human life. the reduced economic activities have led to different sectors to risk shutting down. for instance, in the prevailing state of affairs, a mortgage is somewhat of a gamble because the future remains uncertain for many people. the mortgage industry now relies on government interventions to survive.in the us, the federal government intervened by supporting homeowners to avoid foreclosure. this move could have a negative outcome to the mortgage sector. government involvement is the key to saving the industry. however, if borrowers continue facing financial problems, the industry would still be at risk of total collapse.president donald trump appended his signature to the cares stimulus bill, which provided 2.2 trillion usd. the bill contains a provision assuring homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government could stop remitting their mortgage payments for up to one year if they are having financial challenges. because of the new law, some mortgage lenders allowed their borrowers to discontinue payments.
according to housing experts, the borrowers could also face some hardships. for instance, borrowers in the process of applying for leniency may have to start all over again. in other cases, servicers could mistakenly report borrowers as delinquent on their mortgages even though their forbearance application was approved.furthermore, the challenges around servicing mortgages could make it difficult for americans to get mortgages in the future. if stand-alone mortgage companies’ businesses collapse due to the pandemic, there will be a smaller number of options for americans in the future.in canada, banks were instructed to defer mortgage payments for a minimum of six months. as a result, six major players announced that they would offer their clients a flexible way out, albeit on a case-by-case basis.
in a statement released by the canada bankers association, the banks were willing to defer mortgages indefinitely for non-delinquent clients affected by the pandemic. furthermore, they clarified that the moratorium should not be confused with “mortgage forgiveness” as all interests which would have been part of the postponed payments will be included in the outstanding balance of the mortgage.however, studies have revealed that many homeowners’ long-term financial capability has not been affected by the pandemic. potential homeowners are still in the market for new homes in several regions in the country.in africa, the situation is not very different in terms of the pandemic’s effects on the mortgage industry. take ethiopia, for instance, due to the shortage of housing units even before the pandemic struck, the government (fhc) decided to embark on a national housing project. reports indicate that most mortgages are expensive, making them out of reach for the common man.with the financial crisis hitting ethiopians hard in the current situation, the industry has taken a hit. the government is relying on external financial support to help cushion the various sectors from collapse.from now on, governments across the world will have to liaise with the mortgage providers to help the industry stay afloat. as economies start to reopen, banks and non-bank mortgage providers will have to develop innovative ways of keeping the current clients and attracting new ones. "
"the prominent pencil manufacturer and player in the market, apex plc, disclosed that its sells have almost goes down to almost zero in the last five months after the government decided to suspend education because of covid 19.
the company that is a pioneer and the only manufacturer of pencil in the country said that because of the pandemic its business is seriously affected.
the company told capital that it has a capacity to produce about 400,000 pencils per day and actual production of 80,000, but since the pandemic forced the government to suspend education as of mid-march its sales dropped immediately.
“the situation push us to just settle wages for months without operation,” one of the senior management at the company, that produced dot pencil, said.
“for instance this time is the peak season for the stationary market, but there is no change in our market,” the senior management member, who demands anonymity, told capital.
he reminded that during the past in this period not only the market demand is very high but shortage also occurred.
the company is not only the first to produce the stationary product in the country but its way of production makes it unique and one of the very few in the continent.
the major input for the pencil production is recycling scrap papers like used newspapers.
“we are not using wood or tree products like the traditional input for the pencil industry,” the source says adding “we are contributing for mitigating the environment impact since we use waste paper.”
dot pencil is well accepted in the country. besides its quality it has played significant role to replace the imported pencils.
the source said that the company has a capacity to fill the local demand, meanwhile there are some imports including illegally imported products by the same brand of apex.
“there were individuals who tried to use our brand and import the product from abroad, but they have been legally penalized,” the source explained.
the company located at gelan, in the south east outskirt of addis ababa in oromia region, has more than 160 employees.
“we are paying their salary meanwhile our sales and production is zero,” the source added.
the government disclosed that after the first covid 19 case was reported on friday march 13 schools all over the country were closed to control the pandemic.
currently the global pandemic is significantly spreading not only in the world but also in ethiopia.
the government has not yet set a given time frame when schools will come back to their operation, but because of the spread of the corona virus it is not expected that education centers will return soon.
capital observed that the stationary market particularly that are directly associated with students has significantly dropped.
sources at apex also said that not only their business is affected by the situation but those who are engaged on wholesale and retailing of dot pencil are also affected. “it is easy to know the effect on others since they do not come and buy the product from us,” the source said."
"the unprecedented and prolonged school closures aimed at keeping students safe from covid-19 are harming them in other ways, world health organization (who) and unicef said, urging governments in africa to promote the safe reopening of schools while taking measures to limit the spread of the virus.
a who survey of 39 countries in sub-saharan africa found that schools are fully open in only six countries. they are closed in 14 countries and partially open (exam classes) in 19 others. around a dozen countries are planning to resume classroom learning in september, which is the start of the academic year in some countries.
however, the impact of extended education disruption is significant. it includes among others: poor nutrition, stress, increased exposure to violence and exploitation, childhood pregnancies, and overall challenges in mental development of children due to reduced interaction related to school closures.
in eastern and southern africa, unicef finds that violence rates against children are up, while nutrition rates are down with more than 10 million children missing school meals. for girls, especially those who are displaced or living in low-income households, the risks are even higher. for example, following school closures triggered by the 2014 west africa ebola outbreak, pregnancy rates among teenagers in sierra leone doubled and many girls were unable to continue their education when schools reopened.
the long-term social and economic impact of extended school shutdown is also concerning. according to a world bank modeling, school closures in sub-saharan africa could result in lifetime earning losses of usd 4,500 per child. this may also be worsened by reduced earning of the parents who are forced to stay at home to take care of the children especially in households that cannot afford child care services.
“schools have paved the way to success for many africans. they also provide a safe haven for many children in challenging circumstances to develop and thrive,” said dr matshidiso moeti, who regional director for africa. “we must not be blind-sided by our efforts to contain covid-19 and end up with a lost generation. just as countries are opening businesses safely, we can reopen schools. this decision must be guided by a thorough risk analysis to ensure the safety of children, teachers and parents and with key measures like physical distancing put in place.”
who, unicef and the international federation of red cross have issued guidance on covid-19 prevention and control in schools. the guidance includes recommendations for physical distancing measures such as staggering the beginning and end of the school day, cancelling school events that create crowding, spacing desks when possible, providing handwashing facilities, wearing masks, discouraging unnecessary touching and ensuring that sick students and teachers stay at home.
“the long-term impact of extending the school shutdown risks ever greater harm to children, their future and their communities,” said unicef regional director for eastern & southern africa, mohamed m. malick fall. “when we balance the harm being done to children locked out of schools, and if we follow the evidence, it leads children back into the classroom.”
who and unicef also recommend a range of hygiene and disinfection measures for schools to reopen and operate safely, including regular handwashing, daily disinfection and cleaning of surfaces, basic water, sanitation and waste management facilities, and environmental cleaning and decontamination.
however, millions of children attend schools that lack water, sanitation and hygiene services. in sub-saharan africa, only a quarter of schools have basic hygiene services, 44% of them have basic drinking water and 47% cent have basic sanitation services, according to a who and unicef report assessing progress on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in schools between 2000 and 2019."
"addis ababa city administration has announced the commencement of land audit and registration scheme in a bid to tackle land grab.
the deputy mayor of addis ababa city administration, takele uma has told city officials to take immediate action in granting farmers, who owns farming lands in the city’s surrounding areas, with a legally binding land title deed.
the city administration will give title deeds to lands owned by farmers after they are registered because they are prone to be affected by land grab. the land audit and registration drive will be backed by technological advancements in partnership with ministry of science and innovation, according to mayor’s office.
the deputy mayor urged sub-city officials to begin issuing title deeds to farmers as of monday, august 10. furthermore, he said that he wanted to see each of the respective sub-city official’s announce immediately the commencement of issuing a title deed. the registration of lands owned by farmers will be completed till october 10, 2020.
in related development the addis ababa city administration generated 35.12 billion birr revenue from tax and other activities in the 2019/20 budget year. as the report of the city administration to the council indicates the figure has shown a 7 percent decline from the target which was 37.6 billion birr.
as shown on the report the income was generated from direct and indirect income tax and municipality fees.
the city administration collected 25.93 billion birr from direct tax and 8.3 billion birr from indirect tax and 541.8 million birr from municipality fees."
"fourteen years ago, the bill and melinda gates and rockefeller foundations launched the alliance for a green revolution in africa (agra) with the goal of bringing africa its own green revolution in agricultural productivity. armed with high-yield commercial seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, agra eventually set the goal to double productivity and incomes by 2020 for 30 million small-scale farming households while reducing food insecurity by half in 20 countries.
according to a new report from a broad-based civil society alliance, based partly on new background paper, agra is “failing on its own terms.”
the report states that there has been no productivity surge. “many climate-resilient, nutritious crops have been displaced by the expansion in supported crops such as maize. even where maize production has increased, incomes and food security have scarcely improved for agra’s supposed beneficiaries, small-scale farming households,” the report reads.
the number of undernourished in agra’s 13 focus countries has increased 30% during the organization’s well-funded green revolution campaign, including ethiopia.
“the results of the study are devastating for agra and the prophets of the green revolution,” says jan urhahn, agricultural expert at the rosa luxemburg stiftung, which funded the research and published on july 10, “false promises: the alliance for a green revolution in africa (agra).”
moreover the report further states that massive investments spent promoting and subsidizing commercial seeds and agrichemicals across africa have failed to fulfill their purpose of alleviating hunger and lifting small-scale farmers out of poverty, according to the paper.
in pursuit of its vision, agra has collected nearly usd 1 billion in donations and disbursed usd 524 million, primarily in 13 african countries, on programs promoting the use of commercial seeds, chemical fertilizers and pesticides. this “green revolution” technology package is further supported by subsidies; wise reports that african national governments have spent roughly usd 1 billion per year in the target countries subsidizing the purchase of seeds and agrichemicals.
despite the public support, agra has provided no comprehensive evaluation or reporting on its impacts.
“we find little evidence of widespread progress on any of agra’s goals, which is striking given the high levels of government subsidies for technology adoption,” the researchers report. the paper documents slow productivity growth, no significant increases in food security or small-farmer incomes in the target countries, and worsening hunger.
“the evidence suggests that agra is failing on its own terms,” the paper concludes.
agra said it is “very disappointed” in the research. “over the last 14 years, agra has achieved its successes, but has also learned a lot,” the group said in a statement. agra said the tufts paper failed to meet “basic academic and professional standards of peer review and asking the subject to comment on the ‘findings,’” and accused of having “a history of writing unfounded allegations and uncorroborated reports about agra and its work.”"
"cases in africa surpass 788,000the world health organization (who) announced that more than 10,000 health workers in the 40 countries which have reported on such infections have been infected with covid-19 so far, a sign of the challenges medical staff on the frontlines of the outbreak face. the total number of coronavirus cases across africa has also climbed to 787,501 as of friday july 24 according to the africa centres for disease control and prevention.
this comes as covid-19 cases in africa appear to be gathering pace. there are now more than 750,000 cases of covid-19, with over 15,000 deaths. some countries are approaching a critical number of infections that can place stress on health systems. south africa is now among the worst-hit countries in the world.
“the growth we are seeing in covid-19 cases in africa is placing an ever-greater strain on health services across the continent,” said dr matshidiso moeti, who regional director for africa. “this has very real consequences for the individuals who work in them, and there is no more sobering example of this than the rising number of health worker infections.”
so far, about 10% of all cases globally are among health workers, though there is a wide range between individual countries. in africa, information on health worker infections is still limited, but preliminary data finds that they make up more than 5% of cases in 14 countries in sub-saharan africa alone, and in four of these, health workers make up more than 10% of all infections.
inadequate access to personal protective equipment or weak infection prevention and control measures raise the risk of health worker infection. surging global demand for protective equipment as well as global restrictions on travel have triggered supply shortages. health workers can also be exposed to patients who do not show signs of the disease and are in the health facilities for a range of other services. risks may also arise when health personnel are repurposed for covid-19 response without adequate briefing, or because of heavy workloads which result in fatigue, burnout and possibly not fully applying the standard operating procedures.
in many african countries infection prevention and control measures aimed at preventing infections in health facilities are still not fully implemented. when who assessed clinics and hospitals across the continent for these measures, only 16% of the nearly 30 000 facilities surveyed had assessment scores above 75%. many health centres were found to lack the infrastructure necessary to implement key infection prevention measures, or to prevent overcrowding. only 7.8% (2213) had isolation capacities and just a third had the capacity to triage patients.
in related development the total number of coronavirus cases across africa has climbed to 787,501, the africa centres for disease control and prevention said.
the death toll from the virus in the continent reached 16,697, the latest figures indicate, while a total of 446,082 patients have recovered so far.
the southern africa region has recorded 424,200 cases, north africa 143,300, west africa 114,000, east africa 61,800 and central africa 42,200.
at least 6,400 people have died in southern africa, 6,100 in north africa, 1,800 in west africa, 1,500 in east africa and 871 in central africa.
more than 241,600 patients have recovered in southern africa, 72,800 in west africa, 69,600 in north africa, 34,200 in east africa and 27,800 in central africa.
“one infection among health workers is one too many,” said dr moeti. “doctors, nurses and other health professionals are our mothers, brothers and sisters. they are helping to save lives endangered by covid-19. we must make sure that they have the equipment, skills and information they need to keep themselves, their patients and colleagues safe.”
who has been working closely with health ministries to reduce health worker infections since the outbreak began. the organization has trained more than 50,000 health workers in africa in infection prevention and control, with plans to train over 200,000 more, as well as providing guidance documents and guidelines on best care practices and the most up-to-date treatment regimes.
who is also helping to fill gaps in the supply of personal protective equipment. currently, 41 million items of personal protective equipment are ready to ship from china to cover the needs of 47 african countries. shipments for an initial set of 23 african countries are planned to start during this weekend.
as a result of concerted efforts by who and partners some african countries have managed to reduce health worker infections considerably. for example, two months ago over 16% of covid-19 infections in sierra leone were among health workers. the figure has now dropped to 9%. cote d’ivoire has reduced the proportion of infections among health workers from 6.1% to 1.4%. scaling up infection prevention and control measures can further reduce infections among health workers."
"the world health organization (who) called for greater access to covid-19 detection, testing and care among vulnerable populations grappling with the impacts of protracted conflict and humanitarian emergencies across africa.
sub-saharan africa is home to over 26% of the world’s refugees. long-running conflicts in regions like the sahel have led to the closure of health facilities and the flight of health workers. in burkina faso, 110 health facilities have been closed due to insecurity while services have been impaired in 186 others, leaving around 1.5 million people without adequate health care. in mali’s central and northern regions, health services have been paralysed by persistent attacks. in 2019 alone, 18 attacks on health facilities were reported. so far this year, one health centre has been attacked.
“covid-19 has exacerbated existing humanitarian challenges, particularly with regards to access to health services in many countries in the region,” said dr matshidiso moeti, who regional director for africa. “with the pandemic we have seen some humanitarian operations delayed due to lockdowns, curfews and the restrictions of movement for both personnel and cargo vital for covid-19 response.”
crowded settings such as displacement camps can heighten the risk of covid-19 transmission due to difficult access to clean water, leading to inadequate hygiene, and where physical distancing is almost impossible.
the united nations system has activated health clusters in eight countries where the humanitarian situation requires support from the international community, including burkina faso, central african republic, chad, democratic republic of the congo, ethiopia, mali, niger and south sudan. although information on covid-19 transmission in humanitarian settings remains limited so far, about 1800 covid-19 cases have been reported in seven of these countries among the displaced, refugees, migrants or in areas affected by humanitarian crises. due to the limited detection and testing capacity, the number is likely to be an under-estimate.
“who urges the humanitarian community and member states to increase support to the millions of people in dire need of assistance in the region. if we don’t step up health services, including testing, tracing, isolation and care for people already living in precarious settings and displacement camps, covid-19 could spark untold tragedy,” said dr moeti.
who has developed guidance on adapting covid-19 mitigation in camp or camp-like settings, recommending health screenings for people arriving at collective sites and temporary isolation centres for suspected cases. who advises that activities like food distribution or education be adjusted to limit mass gatherings and strengthen infection prevention and control.
who is working with the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the un refugee agency (unhcr) and other operational partners to raise awareness about covid-19 among vulnerable populations, distribute medical supplies and implement preventive measures such as handwashing stations. efforts are also underway to strengthen surveillance, train health workers, establish telehealth centres, and test and care for people who contract the disease.
the united nations is implementing the global humanitarian response plan for covid-19 to fight the pandemic in countries facing humanitarian situations. the plan identifies ways to address the immediate health and non-health needs related to covid-19 for the most vulnerable populations through health, water, sanitation, hygiene, food and agriculture, logistics, education and protection. of the 63 countries covered by the plan, 20 are in africa."
"ethiopian airlines resumed its international passenger flights after more than three months of break due to the suspension of international passenger travel with the fear of spreading the corona virus.according to ethiopian airlines the airline starts to fly to more than 40 destinations in july. from these vienna, cairo, malabo, marseille, athens, milan, rome, tel aviv, beirut, antananarivo, rossi be, oslo, hargesa, juba, geneva, istanbul, dubai, new york, and zambia are included.sources told capital that the airline is getting ready to start its full passenger flights in august and september.last week ethiopians were one of the 10 countries allowed to enter in the european union territory as the boarders of eu reopened in july. besides ethiopians, mozambique, angola, namibia, zambia, rwanda, uganda, egypt, tunisia, algeria and morocco are included in the list.on march 31 ethiopian airlines announced that it had suspended passenger flights to 80 destinations around the world however because of the surprising spread of the pandemic in the last three months the airline has cut off 90 percent of its international passenger destinations out of its 110 destinations and focus on cargo, maintenance services and charter flights.the corona virus that originated in wuhan, china in december has spread to all countries and regions all over the world.ethiopian airlines is already bracing for income loss of half a billion dollars and has axed most of its scheduled passenger flights, but is turning to cargo and charter operations to soften the blow.in the first three months of the 2020 the airline has announced 550 million dollar in revenue loss although the losses reached one billion dollar in six month starting from january up to june.focusing on cargo flights has enabled the airline to recover from the crises after that outbreak of the pandemic.according to recent reports the airline has make 120 million dollar revenue in a month from cargo services which enabled the state owned aviation group to cover all its monthly expenses.since the air transport is critical to economic and sustainable development in the region recently the air transport association has called on governments in africa to rapidly implement icaos global guideline for resorting air connectivity to ensure the safe and harmonized restart of the aviation in the region."
"the covid-19 pandemic continues to represent an unprecedented health and economic crisis, with costs that will be felt most keenly by the poorest segments of the world’s population, the international monetary fund (imf) said in its latest regional economic outlook for sub-saharan africa.
“this is a fast-moving crisis” said abebe aemro selassie, director of the imf’s african department. “and recent developments suggest that the downturn will be significantly larger than we had anticipated only 10 weeks ago. the risks we highlighted in april all continue to be a concern, but the deterioration of the global outlook has been particularly striking. in line with this new outlook, and consistent with local high-frequency indicators, output in sub-saharan africa is now projected to shrink by 3.2 percent this year, more than double the contraction we had outlined in april. again, this is set to be the worst outcome on record.”
“on the pandemic, the growth rate of new cases has slowed slightly since april, and a number of countries have cautiously eased some of their containment measures. but region-wide, the pandemic is still in its exponential phase-sub-saharan africa has recently exceeded more than a quarter of a million confirmed cases, and new cases are still doubling every 2-3 weeks. given the region’s already-stretched healthcare capacity, the immediate priority is still to protect lives and to do whatever it takes to strengthen local health systems and contain the outbreak,” abebe said.
he further added that on economic policies, sub-saharan african countries have acted swiftly and aggressively to support the economy. “monetary and prudential policies have been eased, with countries adopting a mix of reduced policy rates, added injections of liquidity, greater exchange-rate flexibility, and a temporary relaxation of regulatory and prudential norms, depending on country circumstances.”
on the fiscal side, however, country responses have often been more constrained he said. “even before the crisis, debt levels were elevated for many countries in the region. in this context, and in light of collapsing tax revenues, the ability of governments to increase spending has been limited. to date, countries in the region have announced covid-related fiscal packages averaging 3 percent of gdp. this effort has been indispensable. but it has often come at the expense of other priorities, such as public investment, and is markedly less than the response seen in other emerging markets or advanced economies.”
also, authorities in sub-saharan africa face a distinct challenge in getting support to those who need it most. around ninety percent of non-agricultural employment is in the informal sector, where participants are usually not covered by the social safety net. moreover, a large proportion of this activity centers on the provision of services, which have been particularly hard hit by the crisis. further, informal workers typically have few savings and limited access to finance. so staying at home is often not an option; complicating the authorities’ efforts to maintain an effective lockdown. in response, many authorities have done what they can to temporarily expand their safety nets; using home-grown, often innovative approaches to ensure that transfers reach as much of their population as possible. but again, resources are limited, and these efforts cannot hope to offset the full impact of this crisis.
“in sum, many authorities in sub-saharan africa face a particularly stark set of near-term policy choices; concerning not only the scale of support they can afford, but also the pace at which they can reopen their economies,” he added.
against this backdrop, abebe pointed to a number of policy priorities going forward.
“first and foremost, the immediate priority remains the preservation of health and lives. but as the region starts to recover, authorities should gradually shift from broad fiscal support to more affordable, targeted policies; concentrating in particular on the poorest households and those sectors hit hardest by the crisis.”
“looking even further forward, and once the crisis has waned, countries should refocus their attention on transforming their economies, creating jobs, and boosting living standards-clawing back some of the ground lost during the current crisis. as before the crisis, part of this effort will require putting fiscal positions back on a path consistent with debt sustainability; which will in turn require a renewed determination to implement revenue-mobilization, debt-management, and public financial management reforms. in addition, sustainable, job-rich, and inclusive growth will require private-sector investment, along with a business environment in which new ideas and projects can flourish, and where new opportunities (such as from the digital revolution) can be developed fully,” abebe added.
“none of this will be easy, particularly in light of the scale of the crisis and its longer-term consequences,” he further noted. the region cannot tackle these challenges alone, and a coordinated effort by all development partners will be key. the imf has modified the catastrophe containment and relief trust (ccrt) to provide immediate debt service relief for its poorest and most vulnerable members, and has also doubled its emergency lending facilities. so far, 29 countries in the region have received around $10 billion in funding through these facilities, or through expanded access under existing programs. in april, the g20 also announced the debt service suspension initiative (dssi), which allows the world’s poorest countries-most of them in africa-to suspend up to us$14 billion of debt service payments due between may and december this year.
“nonetheless, more international support is needed urgently. this year alone, countries in the region will face additional financing needs of over $110 billion, and despite the efforts outlined above, $44 billion of this has yet to be financed.”"
"renewable energy sources can play a crucial role to ensure health, food and education to the african population in the covid-19 recovery phase. this is the outcome of the study “the impact of covid-19 on africa’s energy sector”, developed by res4africa foundation and the united nations economic commission for africa (uneca), in partnership with sda bocconi and with the support of the southern african power pool (sapp) and ethiopian women in energy (ewien). the study was presented during a virtual event, which saw the participation of relevant representatives of the european and african energy sector, international agencies and organisations.
even if the spread of covid-19 is lower than in other continents (2.67% of global infections and 1.2% of the global death rate), the research shows that the pandemic heavily impacted africa’s economies, that are suffering severely for their dependency on other economies, by the collapse of commodity prices and for the shutdown of commercial activities in response to the lockdown measures. as a result, the 2020 african gdp growth rate is expected to decline from 3.2% to 1.8% (with a contraction of 1.4%); however, if the shock level is heightened, the gdp contraction could reach up to 2.5%. this slower growth of africa’s economies will have major implications on poverty reduction and employment growth, possibly causing from 5 to 29 million people falling back into extreme poverty.
in such a time of crisis, electricity access plays a fundamental role in securing basic needs and services such as health, food and education; however, the impact of covid-19 on the african energy industry is likely to have dramatic effects on the progress made in recent years in expanding access to energy. the global economic crisis that causes a decrease in energy consumption makes it harder for existing customers and businesses to pay for their energy services and african utilities, some of which were already in difficult financial situations, may further struggle to run their business. at the same time, slowed supply chains and reduced investment flows are causing energy companies to run out of cash, putting many jobs at risk and reducing the customers’ access to energy.
the res4africa-uneca study explains in detail that, in this scenario, the deployment of renewables-based solutions can be a pivotal contribution to africa’s post-covid recovery and to improve the quality of life of millions of people, even long after the end of the pandemic. african leaders and policy makers face a historical opportunity to coordinate their recovery initiatives in response to the pandemic in order to increase their efforts in achieving the sustainable development goal 7: this implies building more robust and efficient energy infrastructure systems as well as implementing decentralised energy solutions using renewable energy sources.
“in this emergency, we must take the opportunity to rethink global systems and accelerate towards an economy that is more sustainable and more attentive to everyone. it’s time to finally unlock africa’s potential and provide renewable energy to its population” states antonio cammisecra, president of res4africa foundation and ceo of enel green power, “covid-19 is not a signal to slow down, but a signal to speed up”.
“the investments in sustainable energy will help mitigate the impact of climate change, while widening access to energy” continues william lugemwa, director of the private sector development and finance division of the uneca, “it will be essential, thanks to the economic and financial stimulus that will follow this crisis, to build and strengthen the energy system in a clean and sustainable way, pursuing a deep de-carbonisation and to prepare a more resilient socio-economic system to external shocks such as covid-19”.
“placing renewable energy at the heart of covid-19 recovery measures is crucial to bridge the energy access gap and build a resilient and sustainable economy” comments rabia ferroukhi, director knowledge, policy and finance of the international renewable energy agency (irena), “with the right policy frameworks in place, investments in renewables will bring much needed jobs, gdp growth and welfare gains – key to africa’s long-term prosperity”.
“the iea’s new sustainable recovery plan shows it is possible to simultaneously spur economic growth, create millions of jobs, put emissions into structural decline and provide a substantial boost to the resilience of energy systems” adds maximilian jarrett, africa programme manager of the international energy agency (iea), “it’s a plan that could significantly benefit the energy sector and wider economy across africa”.
“renewables, thanks to their decreasing costs and greater resilience, as demonstrated during the coronavirus pandemic, are helping with the energy transition on a global scale, enabling society to make progress on several of the seventeen sustainable development goals” concludes matteo di castelnuovo, professor of sda bocconi and director of its africa lab."
"the ethiopian electric power (eep) announced that the theft of the electric transmission tower at the eastern part of addis ababa is the first of its kind that happened in the city.
on june 24 the 132 kilo volt power transmission tower located around bole lemi industry park was damaged by individuals who then stole part of the tower.
the incident affected the power supply at the industry park and surrounding areas of addis ababa for days.
moges mekonnen, public relation head at eep, said that such kind of theft particularly in the capital city is new.
“meanwhile the robbery affects very limited part of the city the damage is very huge that cost big amount for those who depend on it,” moges said.
according to the public relation head, the power transmission line theft usually happen mainly in southern part of the country like wolaita, gamo gofa and sidama zones, while the current incident is very rare for cities.
“our towers are stretched all over the country and passes through forests and mountains and mainly the bandits’ focus on the towers located in remote areas,” he added.
he told capital because of the theft at bole lemi the conductor is damaged and the loss is estimated to be about half a million birr.
“the power supplied to the industry park, which is mainly engaged on the production of textile for export, is significant but the details will be disclosed by ethiopian electric utility, which is responsible to administer the power distribution,” he added.
according to the statement eep disclosed on its social media on june 24 besides the industry park, summit condo compound, bole arabsa, airlines association residential area, goro, ict park, gerji wore genu, and gerji kazanches were affected.
eep’s transmission and substation operation division technicians have been in duty to maintain the damage until we went to print on saturday afternoon. moges said that the line is expected to commence operation by sunday june 28.
he reminded that eep, which is so far the sole power generator and distributors, was under preparation to organize a symposium with relevant organizations and government entities of law enforcement to tackle the theft problem, but the current covid 19 incident suspended the plan."
"africa’s wild polio-free status to be determined in augusthumanitarian crises, including health emergencies affect men and women differently. as covid-19 continues to spread in africa, there are concerns over its impact on women and girls, with vulnerabilities feared to worsen as the pandemic overwhelms health systems.
although overall in the african region, women account for around 40% of covid-19 cases, this ranges from 35% in some countries to over 55% in south africa.
“we are already seeing that the impact of covid-19 on women and girls is profound. women are disproportionately affected by lockdowns and this is resulting in a reduced access to health services,” said dr matshidiso moeti, world health organization (who) regional director for africa.
as efforts are focused on curbing the spread of covid-19, essential services such as access to sexual and reproductive health services have been disrupted. according to preliminary data, in zimbabwe, the number of caesarean sections performed decreased by 42% between january and april 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. the number of live births in health facilities fell by 21%, while new clients on combined birth control pills dropped by 90%. in burundi, initial statistics show that births with skilled attendants fell to 4749 in april 2020 from 30 826 in april 2019.
recent analysis published in the lancet global health suggests that a reduction in maternal health services of between just 9.8-18.5% could lead to as many as 12 200 additional maternal deaths over six months in low- and middle-income countries.
the economic hardship due to covid-19 is also greater for women according to a world bank report. informal workers, most of whom are women, account for more than 90% of the labour force in sub-saharan africa. informal sector jobs are particularly at risk during the pandemic.
in addition, women face a higher risk of gender-based violence in the wake of the covid-19 outbreak. a recent study by un women found that reports of violence against women, and particularly domestic violence, have increased in several countries as security, health, and financial worries create tensions and strains accentuated by the cramped and confined living conditions of lockdown.
“we are working with governments and partners to find ways to continue to deliver essential services safely, including the provision of personal protective equipment to health workers, many of whom are nurses and are women,” said dr moeti.
the burden of caring for the sick is also largely borne by women. most health workers in africa are women. over the past four months, with the colleges of nursing in africa who has provided targeted virtual trainings to over 1000 nurses and midwives. in west africa, this training has been cascaded sub-nationally using virtual platforms – thus allowing as many nurses as possible to be trained in case management for covid-19 and infection prevention and control.
who works to improve the health of women and girls in africa by developing guidance on the implications of gender, gender-based violence, and access to sexual and reproductive health.
in a related statement the independent africa regional certification commission (arcc), responsible for certifying the eradication of wild poliovirus in the world health organization (who) african region, is set to make its final decision about the region’s wild poliovirus status in august 2020.
following field verification visits over the past year and thorough critical analysis of the documentation of the polio surveillance, immunization and laboratory capacity presented by the governments of cameroon, central african republic, nigeria and south sudan, the commission has validated that the countries’ documentation grants them wild polio-free status.
in august 2019, the african region became eligible to be certified free of wild poliovirus, after nigeria, the last wild poliovirus endemic country, recorded no new cases three years – the requisite period – since it last reported cases of wild poliovirus. the commission had already accepted the documentation of the other 43 countries in the region.
“we are satisfied with the documentation that the four countries have presented. we are reviewing updated reports from the other 43 countries in the who african region and we anticipate that by august 2020, we will deliver our final decision on the region’s certification status of wild poliovirus eradication,” said professor rose leke, arcc chairperson.
“this achievement by cameroon, central african republic, nigeria and south sudan is a major step towards the eradication of wild poliovirus in the african region,” said dr matshidiso moeti. “as the continent struggles with covid-19, this milestone shows that when leaders, partners, health workers and communities come together we can triumph over the most difficult health challenges.”
if the region is certified in august, it would be the fifth of the six who regions to be declared free of wild polio. however, the scale of ongoing circulating vaccine-derived polio outbreaks is a battle the region is striving to win."
"the nyu stern center for business and human rights released a new report on the approach to content moderation taken by major social media companies, including facebook, youtube and twitter. the report, “who moderates the social media giants? a call to end outsourcing,” presents new findings about how big tech firms regulate the content that appears on their platforms; identifies major problems with the platforms’ current approach; and makes concrete recommendations for reforms.
facebook, youtube and twitter outsource most of their human content moderation-the job of deciding what stays online and what gets taken down-to third-party contractors, which creates a marginalized class of reviewers who are seen as “second-class citizens.” the nyu report finds that the peripheral status of moderators has contributed to inadequate attention being paid to incendiary content spread in developing countries, sometimes leading to violence offline. outsourcing has also contributed to the provision of subpar mental health support for content moderators who spend their days staring at disturbing material.
paul barrett, deputy director of the nyu stern center for business and human rights told capital that the report finds social media companies lack local expertise in countries like ethiopia. “they should hire more ethiopians with broad language skills and a solid grasp of the country’s culture” barrett said.
“online speech foments ethnic and religious violence and hostilities, one thing social media companies can do is to remove content that is false and may lead to physical harm,” he further added.
focusing primarily on facebook, the report found that every day, three million facebook posts are flagged for review by 15,000 moderators. the company has admitted to at least a 10 percent error rate in making content decisions, which suggests 300,000 mistakes a day. at facebook, outsourced content moderation takes place in more than 20 sites worldwide.
“the report finds that facebook and others rely on unpaid local activists and ngos to monitor online speech, but often ignore their warnings. there have been communication breakdowns and inattentiveness. facebook says this is changing-that it is listening more closely to its partners on the ground. perhaps the company has learned from past experience. but all of these problems have not been fully solved,” the deputy director told capital via email.
“social media companies cannot cure all societal ills, including the incitement of violence. these companies need to do more to ensure against the misuse of their platforms. but there is a big role for civil society organizations, journalism outfits, and, in some cases, the government, in fostering civility and diminishing the influence of bad actors. political leaders must come together and get behind education efforts aimed at enlightening social media users and all citizens,” barrett said.
the report also calls on big tech to invest more in countries like ethiopia to prevent violence from spreading virally.
“more attentive content moderation and fact-checking, more social media literacy training, and more support for public-spirited journalism and civil society activity should be done,” barrett said.
in recent months, the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated problems with content moderation. as content moderators have sheltered in place at home, without access to secure computers, social media companies, including facebook, announced that they would rely more on ai to remove harmful content. the result has been that the platforms have mistakenly taken down some legitimate content from healthcare professionals and others, whose posts were mistakenly flagged for removal.
“the widespread practice of relying on third-party vendors for content review amounts to an outsourcing of responsibility for the safety of major social media platforms and their billions of users,” said paul barrett adding “the results of this practice range from moderators not receiving the caliber of mental health care they deserve, to real-world violence in some countries where insufficient moderation leads to hateful content remaining online.”
this report involved dozens of interviews with executives from facebook and other tech firms, as well as with former content moderators operating in the u.s. and europe; scholars and researchers studying the issue; and on-the-ground activists and ngos."
"well-functioning transit transport services and procedures are essential to ensure people in landlocked developing countries have timely access to medical products and basic goods during and after the crisis.
when borders around the globe close, every country suffers, but those without territorial access to the sea are affected in unique ways, said a united nations statement urging governments to provide smooth transit transport for landlocked neighbors.
issued on 9 june by six un agencies, the statement warned that economic and social conditions in many landlocked developing countries (lldcs) – often the poorest in their regions – are worsening rapidly due to covid-19 lockdown measures and international restrictions on the movement of goods and people.
on average, these 32 vulnerable nations lag behind the world average by 20% in the un’s human development index. one-third of their 440 million inhabitants live in extreme poverty, 51% face food insecurity daily, and 40% lack access to electricity.
“the impacts of a combined lockdown measures, health pandemic and a global recession will likely halt or potentially even reverse lldcs’ progress towards the sustainable development goals and the aspirations included in the vienna programme of action for the lldcs for the decade 2014-2024,” it said.
the vienna programme of action was adopted by the international community in recognition of the complex challenges facing lldcs and their special development needs.
the statement was signed by the heads of unctad, the un office of the high representative for the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states (un-ohrlls), and the un’s regional economic and social commissions for africa (un eca), asia and the pacific (un escap), europe (un ece) and latin america and the caribbean (un eclac).
even in normal times, functioning and efficient transport networks and procedures are crucial to connect these vulnerable nations to world markets, as their exports and imports must transit through at least one neighbouring state and often have to change the transport mode – making trade much more complex and costly.
“in these unprecedented times, there is an even more urgent need to ensure smooth transport of goods to and from these countries,” the statement said.
it added: “transit transport is critical for lldcs in both the short-term health response to the crisis by ensuring the delivery of much-needed medical equipment and basic goods, and the long-term economic response by facilitating trade and access to global markets and spurring economic pick-up post covid-19.”
in addition to asserting the un’s readiness to continue its support to lldcs and their trading partners, the statement pleaded for decisive and immediate action to help landlocked developing countries while continuing to protect global public health."
"the world stands on the brink of a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the un has warned as it urged governments to act swiftly to avoid disaster.
better social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the coronavirus pandemic may put basic nutrition beyond their reach, the un secretary general, antónio guterres, said on june 9.
he also called for an immediate action to avoid a “global food emergency,” saying more than 820 million people are hungry, some 144 million children under 5-years-old are stunted, and the covid-19 pandemic is making things worse.
he said there is more than enough food to feed the world’s 7.8 billion people but “our food systems are failing.”
the u.n. chief launched a policy briefing on the impact of covid-19 on food security and nutrition which said before the pandemic more than 820 million people were “chronically food insecure,” with 135 million at crisis levels or worse.
“that number could nearly double before the end of the year due to the impacts of covid-19,” the briefing said.
and guterres said some 49 million extra people may fall into extreme poverty due to the pandemic and its impact.
noting forecasts of a global economic downturn this year, he warned that every percentage point drop in global gdp means an additional 700,000 stunted children.
according to the briefing, measures to tackle the covid-19 pandemic are affecting global food supply chains.
“border restrictions and lock-downs are, for example, slowing harvests in some parts of the world, leaving millions of seasonal workers without livelihoods, while also constraining transport of food to markets,” the u.n. briefing said.
it pointed to the forced closure of meat processing plants and food markets in many locations because of serious covid-19 outbreaks.
agnes kalibata, the u.n. special envoy to a food systems summit scheduled in 2021, said “from the u.s. to india, produce is rotting in the fields as lock-downs keep people from harvesting and planting crops.”
“that means less income for desperately hungry people to buy food and less food available, at higher prices,” she said in a statement. “and this is happening across the world.”
kalibata also said millions of liters of milk are being dumped in the united kingdom for lack of buyers “while in colombia families hang red flags outside their windows to indicate they are hungry.”
the briefing said high levels of unemployment, loss of income, and rising food costs are also making access to food difficult.
to address food security during the pandemic, guterres said food and nutrition services must be designated as essential, and food workers must be protected.
he said countries must ensure access for the most vulnerable “to safe, nutritious foods, particularly for young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, older people and other at-risk groups.”
and he urged investment in food systems that better address the needs of food producers and workers and provide “more inclusive access to healthy and nutritious food so we can eradicate hunger.”
guterres also called for re-balancing the relationship between food systems and the environment.
“we cannot forget that food systems contribute up to 29 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, including 44 per cent of methane, and are having a negative impact on biodiversity,” he said.
kalibata, the u.n. envoy, said “countries face an agonizing trade-off between saving lives or livelihoods or, in a worst-case scenario, saving people from covid-19 to have them die from hunger.”"
"tax payers express their confusion on the implementation of tax amnesty that targets to mitigate the coronavirus economic effects.
the council of ministers recently issued a directive to lift a tax claim in two separate schemes that is based on the period of the tax arrears.
the first group listed under the tax dispute stayed until a period of 2015. in this group the government closed the case and called the tax payers to access their clearance. on the other group the tax payers that are in dispute with ministry of revenue (mor) for tax arrears from 2016 to 2019 are beneficiary to settle their outstanding tax and exempted the interest payment and penalties.
in the second option tax payers have got two types of option for their settlement. the first one is settled the 25 percent at an initial stage and the balance within a year, while the second option is that companies will settle the 90 percent at a time and get a relief for the ten percent.
according to tax payers that capital talked said that they are facing challenges when they try to settle their payment.
“a tax branch that we are reporting told us that we should settle 100 percent of the tax immediately against the scheme that the council of ministers issued,” a tax payer told capital.
the tax payer said that they talked to tesfaye tule, state minister of mor, to claim their case while they got a response that the detail procedural document of the directive will not allow them to go with the new scheme.
“they told me that the new relief is given for those who finalized their process before the issuance date, which was may 6, of the directive, and due to that we settled all the outstanding taxes at a time,” claimed the tax payer.
according to one of the tax payers, their company planned to pay the 25 percent first and the balance in a year time. “they told us we can only be exempted from the interest and penalty but should pay 100 percent immediately.”
the tax payers claimed that they are confused by the tax authority’s decision and the directive given by the government.
“as the behavior of my business and the current situation i could not settle all the 100 percent of the taxes,” a tax payer, who hoped to pay their duty in different stages, expressed frustration.
the government stated that its tax revenue would be shrinking due to the virus. recently ahmed shide, minister of finance, said that government will lose 11 billion birr in the months before the end of the budget year.
“the government said that the tax and non tax collection in the coming months of the budget year will shrink by 11 billion birr, while the indirect tax collection for march has dropped by close to 15 percent compared with the same period of last year,” ahmed said.
in march the direct tax collection growth rate was limited to 1.6 percent, while the average growth rate pre covid 19 months was 22.8 percent, according to ahmed."
"the coronavirus pandemic significantly shrinks the leather export, one of the major hard currency earners for the country; meanwhile the leather industry development institute (lidi) appreciates the performance compared with the challenge of the virus.
the sector has achieved 42 percent of the export target 0r usd 65.5 million in ten months of the budget year which the institute projected to generate usd 157 million in the stated period.
berhanu serjabo, corporate communication head at lidi, said that the global outbreak has significantly damaged the sector. “in the budget year, which is 2019/20 we expected to register a significant growth from the leather sector after the government take massive measures to improve it,” the corporate communication head told capital.
“before covid19 becomes a challenge at the global stage the leather export was held in good manner, but since february, a month that the virus expanding its root all over the world the sector performance is seriously affected,” he added.
so far until may 8 the leather sector has generated usd 65.5 million that is 42 percent of the target, according to berhanu.
“we highly anticipated to register good performance for the year, meanwhile this sudden pandemic has changed the overall condition,” he added.
even though the leather sector was one of the major hard currency source for the country, it could not continue as its previous strength. currently newly introduced sectors like horticulture have surpassed the leather sector.
experts and pioneer leather sector actors, most of them are local investors, criticized the government for weak performance on the sector.
tanneries argued that the proclamation introduced about 12 years ago significantly damaged the sector and even bankrupt some investors.
the raw and semi-processed hides and skins export tax proclamation no. 567/2008 imposed a discouraging tax of up to 150 percent for unprocessed or semi processed leather products, which local investors argued is untimely and affect the sector.
however lately in the current budget year the government lifted the proclamation and is working with actors to provide support like finance and lifting customs constrains, according to berhanu, “due to the government’s attention given to the sector we have expected a marvelous achievement.”
“most of the tanneries were returning to their previous condition and were finalizing to commence their export when the virus becomes a pandemic,” he added.
in the 2019/20 budget year the government targeted to earn usd 201 million. a year ago the sector generated usd 120.3 million.
meanwhile covid 19 seriously affects the export of leather and leather goods, according to lidi to some extent products mainly leather goods like bags and glove are being exported.
“now we have given priority for tackling the virus and keep the safety of employees and at the same time industries to continue their production with precautions,” he says adding “in the stated manner industries continue producing their products meanwhile their products at the current stage could not be exported as they used to be.”
currently, there are 27 tanneries, 24 footwear manufacturers, four glove producers and 19 leather product exporting industries in the country that lidi, which is under ministry of trade and industry, follows.
in the 2008 financial crisis the leather sector faces similar problems, while berhanu hopes that the current problem will be easy when the global lockdown starts opening up."
"the outbreak is hitting somalia the hardest, with kenya, ethiopia, uganda and south sudan also heavily impacted 
previous swarms have already damaged tens of thousands of hectares of cropland and pasturealmost five million people could be plunged into hunger and famine as a fourth round of desert locusts hatch and ravage crops across the horn and east africa, compounding an already dire food situation worsened by the covid-19 pandemic. the infestation, which first arrived in east africa last june, is feeding on hundreds of thousands of hectares of crops across at least eight countries. another round of hatching could produce swarms up to 8,000 times larger than the first generation earlier this year. the international rescue committee (irc) is calling for a major ramp up of preventive measures to stop the swarms from destroying lives and spreading across west africa and to the indo-pakistan border.
barri shorey, senior director of economic recovery for the irc, said, “the desert locust is the world’s most dangerous migratory pest. a one-square-kilometer locust swarm is capable of consuming the same amount of food in one day as approximately 35,000 people. the worst outbreak in 70 years is combined with a year of drought and flooding, and now a covid-19 pandemic preventing people from working and farming, poses an unprecedented risk to food security. without an immediate increase of prevention measures, we could be on the verge of a famine like we have never seen before.”
like all crises, women and girls are experiencing the locust outbreak differently. female-headed households remain particularly vulnerable as women manage their crops as well as the additional unpaid labor within the home. it is important to specifically account for the challenges women and girls face in response efforts.
somalia is being hit the hardest. already, more than half of irc supported communities’ land have been affected by the latest infestation. the country, which was still recovering from the severe 2017 drought, was hit by another drought in 2019 and has since seen massive flooding and now a spiraling covid-19 pandemic. without immediate help, 3.5 million people are projected to face a food crisis in somalia.
sahal farah, community resilience committee vice chairman for docol, an irc partner organization, said, “this is the worst locust invasion we have seen in our generation; it has destroyed pastures, contaminated water sources and displaced many pastoral households. the worst part is that we do not have the capacity to control it, and so far, we have not received any external support.”
without intervention, the food and agriculture organization predicts a 50-70 percent cereal harvest loss in somalia. the irc estimates that 5,000 households, especially those headed by women, currently do or will need urgent humanitarian assistance by august if harvests fail and market prices rise. the irc is scaling up multipurpose cash assistance and farming support to reach all 5,000 at risk households.
the irc is engaged in a desert locust task force in somalia, informing the community on best practices to control the outbreak, training community resilience committees (crc) on control measures and providing farming and agriculture support to locust affected smallholder farmers. but, the irc is only a portion of those working to help those impacted by this devastating plague. in 2017, the world came together to prevent famine in somalia. this can be done again. with more funding, the irc and its partner organizations can reach more of the most vulnerable, particularly women and girls, and prevent a devastating hunger crisis.
the irc has launched a us 30 million appeal to help us mitigate the spread of coronavirus among the world’s most vulnerable populations. we are working across three key areas: to mitigate and respond to the spread of coronavirus within vulnerable communities; protect irc staff; and ensure the continuation of our life-saving programming as much as possible across more than 40 countries worldwide."
"the ministry of trade and industry has authorized only governmental development enterprises to directly distribute cement from factories to the open market.
“the high price of cement on the open market has stressed the construction sector despite the ministry’s effort to control the price and protect the construction sector,” said eshete asfaw, sate minister of trade and industry.
eshete added that the enterprises will purchase cement from the local cement manufactures and distribute it with a fair price to smaller retailers.
the illegal increasing price of cement in the open market has rise challenges on the construction industry.
to solve the problem on may 29, 2020 the ministry held talks with different stakeholders.
according to the ministry most of the stakeholders raise the inefficient control of the government on the market as the main problem to the price hike.
according to eshete the decision will continue until situations get to the point as they were before the pandemic.
cement known as the back bone of the construction world typically a heavy-consuming cement market, ethiopian cement production had proven insufficient to meet demand.
back in the past years through the development of the construction industry massive public investment and infrastructure projects increase the demand and consumption of cement.
according to the ministry because of the current situation cement factories are working by their 50 percent capacity, although to benefit from the market some traders are increasing the price of cement as there is shortage of production.
as one of the mandates of the enterprises are to ensure supply of industrial inputs whenever necessary for trade and industry, the profit rate of the enterprise is much lower than the retail market. “the lower rate of the profit will solve the challenges facing the construction sector” said eshete.
cement producers are tackling a long list of challenges, unfavorable supply-demand balance, higher cement prices, escalating production costs, low utilization rates, social unrest, and a lack of foreign currency.
the ministry has been making manufactures set constant prices and pursue their distributers.
according to the ministry, in the retail market cement is sold around 350 birr per quintal but currently it reaches up to 600 birr.
currently the country has a capacity to produce 17.1 million quintals of cement per annum.
ethiopia’s cement capacity grew at an annual average rate of 6.8 percent between 2013 and 2018, according to data from cement world group."
"ethiopian hotel professionals associations asked the government to control over the implementation of directives and regulations imposed on employment, layoff and termination.
as stated by the board members of the association on may 29, 2020, there are hotels which are laying off employees, cutting off their salary and not protecting their employees from getting affected by the virus.
“we have heard 14 hotels with different cases related with employment lay off and salary cut, we are trying to solve them,” leulseged mesele president of the association said.
according to the association there is a huge mess on implementing the national directives and lacks follow up from the government side.
we have been calling the hotels to come and talk on the issue, but we don’t get any response. also we are communicating with the culture and tourism ministry, ministry of labor and social affairs there is no solution.
as the spread of the virus continue the government prohibits companies from laying off workers and terminating employments in a measure introduced as part to protect citizens from economic crises.
and to mitigate the damages of the pandemic and alleviate economic crisis on industries that have fallen such as tourism, hospitality and the horticulture the government has been aggressively implementing different measurements including financial injection.
according to the government, these sectors can borrow from commercial banks with low interest rates mainly to pay their employees salary and survive the crises together.
banks are rescheduling, annulling or reducing interest rate and reschedule loan for sectors like hospitality, tourism and horticulture for three months and above to mitigate the effect on their clients mainly for those who are highly affected.
according to the board members of the association even if such kind of efforts has been made by the government to support the sector and protect employees, there are hotels who are not abiding by the rules.
according to leulseged, most of the hotels took the loan from banks but still there are problems on the implementation.
“most of the employees are low paid workers, we do not have to expect them to pay back the loan rather we need to stand together and pass this time,” said sendu getachew vice president of the association.
beside the state of emergency, recently the country has launched work place respond protocol agreement between the government, employers and employees, of work force protocol to encompasses measures taken to fight against the pandemic virus covid 19.
guideline for response to crisis management which was signed between three parties’ ministry of labor and social affairs, the confederation of labor and confederation of trade unions, urge basic workplace protection strategies to be implemented by employers, employees and safety committee that includes precautions to be taken.
following the spread of covid -19 and the subsequent travel restrictions impacting the international travel-tour industry, hotels are partially or fully closed due to low occupancy rate. currently 98 percent of the market in the industry is dead and the rest two percent is on hotels used as quarantine according to the association.
following this most of the hotels are about to change their faces to serve as quarantine centers."
"ethiopian bottled water, soft drink, fruit and vegetable manufacturing industries association (ebsfmia) ask ministry of finance (mof) to suspend excise tax and value added tax (vat) for the time being.
in a letter the association sent to mof stated that its members are highly affected because of the outbreak of coronavirus.
“as per our evaluation the sector particularly the bottled water business is significantly affected by the outbreak,” the letter signed by ashenafi merid, general manager of ebsfmia, states.
it added that the pandemic that follows by ceasing businesses at hotel and restaurants has significantly dropped the sales of water bottlers business.
“cancelation of mass gathering like conference, concerts, exhibitions and other meetings and suspending day to day operations at addis ababa based international and continental organizations and diplomatic missions have also contributed for market slowdown,” the association explained.
according the ebsfmia, these effects has dropped the bottled water business by up to 85 percent and that forced them made them unable to settle the dues that were supposed to be paid for the government.
in its letter copied to the ministry of trade and industry and ministry of revenue the association asked the government to cease the excise tax payment. besides that it demands the lifting of vat for some period, but it did not state a given period.
ebsfmia has also claimed to benefit from the loan interest rate relief and rescheduling of loan settlement period at banks.
“if such decisions could not be applied the sector will be in trouble to pay wages and continue its operation,” the letter states.
since covid 19 imposes challenges on the economy the government has been taking several measures for vulnerable sectors. at the same time financial institutions have also applied loan settlement reschedule for almost all who demanded, while they have also cut interest rate fully or partly for some sectors like hospitality, horticulture and industry sector for a given period of time.
meanwhile vat payment has been rescheduled by the government. in this regard ebsfmia would be the first that demands the annulations of such kind of taxes including excise tax.
the water bottling sector is responsible to collect 10 percent excise tax from sales. according to information capital obtained from the sector, some big bottlers may pay up to five million birr per month as excise tax.
ashenafi expressed his hope that the government will come up with good response to save the sector.
he told capital that the sector has created about 50,000 jobs and rapidly growing.
“at least we need some relief to alleviate this bad situation,” he added.
according to the general manager, the partial lockdown that suspend most activities particularly mass gathering has seriously affected the sector.
“different meetings and conferences have been the major source of business for the bottled water industry that is currently fully abandoned all over the country due to covid 19,” he says, “besides that different offices and the hospitality business are major users of bottled water but currently offices like international organizations have almost closed their offices and the business activity at entertainment areas also dropped, which directly affects us.”
he recalled that at the initial stage when covid 19 case was reported in ethiopia the market showed a boost because of the households, who were buying bulk of bottled water but it is now almost nil. “households are not potential customers in the past,” he added.
the association has over 80 members from over 90 water bottlers in the country."
"global economic output will be slashed by $8.5 trillion over next two yearsthe world health organization (who) expressed concern at the potential impact of covid-19 on food security, which is likely to exacerbate the already considerable burden of malnutrition in africa. the impact of the disease is expected to be greater among those grappling with food scarcity and malnutrition, while widespread food insecurity will likely increase due to movement restrictions.
“covid-19 is unfolding in africa against a backdrop of worrying levels of hunger and undernourishment, which could worsen as the virus threatens livelihoods and household economies,” said dr matshidiso moeti, who regional director for africa in her regular online briefing. “hunger and malnutrition heighten vulnerability to diseases, the consequences of which could be far reaching if not properly addressed.”
in africa, it is estimated that one in five people is undernourished, and that 30% of children under five – approximately 59 million children – have stunted growth, greater than the global average of 21.9%. wasting occurs in approximately 7.1% of children in africa. the continent has the highest burden of malnutrition compared with other parts of the world, in terms of percentage of the population. while there has been little research so far into malnutrition as a co-morbidity for covid-19, people with weakened immune systems as a result of undernourishment are at greater risk of a range of serious illnesses and so are likely to be more severely affected by the virus.
recent estimates of food insecurity have suggested that as many as 73 million people in africa were acutely food insecure. covid-19 is exacerbating food shortages, as food imports, transportation and agricultural production have all been hampered by a combination of lockdowns, travel restrictions and physical distancing measures.
in a separate news according to the united nations world economic situation and prospects (wesp) mid-2020 report, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by 3.2 percent this year.
the global economy is expected to lose nearly $8.5 trillion in output over the next two years due to the covid-19 pandemic, wiping out nearly all gains of the previous four years. the sharp economic contraction, which marks the sharpest contraction since the great depression in the 1930s, comes on top of anemic economic forecasts of only 2.1 percent at the start of the year.
the report estimates that gdp growth in developed economies is expected to plunge to -5.0% in 2020. a modest, 3.4% growth – barely enough to make up for the lost output – is expected in 2021. world trade is forecast to contract by nearly 15 per cent in 2020 amid sharply reduced global demand and disruptions in global supply chains.
the report also stated that the pandemic will likely cause an estimated 34.3 million people to fall below the extreme poverty line in 2020, with 56% of this increase occurring in african countries. an additional 130 million people may join to the ranks of people living in extreme poverty by 2030, dealing a huge blow to global efforts for eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. the pandemic, which is disproportionately hurting low-skilled, low-wage jobs, while leaving higher-skilled jobs less affected – will further widen income inequality within and between countries.
facing an unprecedented health, social and economic crisis, governments across the world have rolled out large fiscal stimulus measures – equivalent to an estimated 10 per cent of gdp – to combat the pandemic and minimize its livelihood impacts. however, the depth and severity of the crisis foreshadows a slow and painful recovery.
elliott harris, un chief economist and assistant secretary-general for economic development stated that “the pace and strength of the recovery from the crisis not only hinges on the efficacy of public health measures in slowing the spread of the virus, but also on the ability of countries to protect jobs and incomes, particularly of the most vulnerable members of our societies.”
the report also highlights the pandemic could foster a new normal, fundamentally reshaping human interactions, inter-dependence, trade and globalization, while accelerating digitalization and automation. a rapid surge in economic activities online will likely eliminate many existing jobs, while creating new jobs in the digital economy. the net wage and employment effects could be negative, further aggravating income inequality."
"the covid-19 pandemic significantly affects the ethiopian economy like others since the case is a global problem.
experts said that the country’s economy has been affected by the virus since the first case was reported in mid-march in ethiopia.
they said that meanwhile the first case in ethiopia is reported in the country about two months ago the economic effect was experienced before that since the country is directly related with global actors.
for instance tamirat wondyrad, a project engineer at the industrial scale bakery, sheger bread factory, recently told capital that the factory that is now in the last stage of commissioning has been affected because of the outbreak of the virus.
“the coronavirus affects our activity,” tamirat says, adding “the transformer that will be planted at the factory with a capacity to bake 80,000 million loaves of bread per hour, was procured from wuhan, a chinese city that the first case of covid-19 reported.”
“most of other works are finalized, while the bakery that consume over 5mw needs sustainable power supply. however the transformer is delayed because of the pandemic,” tamirat told capital.
he added that the number of workers at the project site located at qality has reduced to keep the social distancing that has also affects the activity.
similar effects have been observed in other areas. recently the hotel association in the capital city stated that its member’s hotel occupancy rate has dropped to 2 percent that contributed to millions of dollars loss in the hospitality industry.
the hospitality industry challenge is similar for the tourism sector, while the effect in the horticulture industry is much higher.
tewodros zewdie, executive director of the ethiopian horticulture producer exporters association, told capital that the pandemic is a disaster for fresh flower sector.
he said that it has damaged the sector heavily as companies are unable to run their usual export.
the government also immediately came to action particularly for the horticulture sector that followed by hospitality and tourism sector.
it lifted some kind of taxes for selected sectors. laeke ayalew, minister of revenue, said that the government revenue mainly from import export sector would be dropped because of the virus effect.
it has cut several expenses for the sector to keep their employees and bypass the disaster. at the same time financial institutions are taking initiatives by themselves and are also forced by the central bank, national bank of ethiopia (nbe) to be part of the mitigation plan.
but they are not comfortable by the private sector who demand more measures from the private banks.
“we understand businesses are highly affected by the outbreak, but they are operational for almost eight months of the budget year until the outbreak was reported in ethiopia,” a banker told capital.
“for instance the peak season for the hospitality industry, which has several incentives by the government, has passed before the outbreak but they did not consider that and exaggerated and claimed that they are on bad condition to pay salaries and other expenses,” observers said.
a bank president stated that it is relevant expecting more from banks by the government but the private sector is demanding extraordinary measures.
“if you see the manufacturing industry that was highly affected by several factors like power shortage and lack of adequate input access or foreign currency to import raw material before this crises, but it did not get such kind of support,” the bank president said. he added that the manufacturing industry is similarly heavily in debt even more than the hospitality sector that demands high relief because of covid-19.
according to the bank president, at the same time the manufacturing industry is also affected by the virus.
“now some private sectors are making their profit private and socialize their losses,” a banker criticized the behavior.
recently the private sector claimed that it did not get finance from banks, meanwhile the government provided private banks 15 billion birr to keep their liquidity in good condition.
“such as recently the private industry claimed for nbe that it did not get additional finance from banks, even though the government injected 15 billion birr. this indicates how some private sector actors demand using the opportunity to abuse the system. even some of them expected a debt cancelation, which is amazing,” the bank president said.
few weeks ago on their virtual conference with central bank officials the bank leaders expressed their disappointment that the private sector is misunderstand the government’s initiative.
“i don’t mind the interest of the government who demands more action from banks as they are better than other economic actors but the savage behaviors from some private sector actors is very disappointing,” another bank president told capital.
“some of the customers for example are demanding a three year extension for loan settlement. the problem might be solved in the coming six months or it will be extended if the case is continued, but it is strange to demand such incentives as of today on public money,” a banker expressed his disappointment.
“the case is in early stage but the private sector actors exaggerated the challenge they faced after they operated almost for two third of the budget year,” he added.
at the same time the government is highly responsible to control the health of the banking industry, according to finance sector experts, since they are expected to continue on their profitability for the health of the country and the overall economy of the country.
it may be a time to go on the breakeven level for these few months but it is not similar for banks like other sector. “we might be working for 8 months of the year but if the effect will continue we would not declare dividend even if the banks registered profit,” another bank president told capital.
“we would see the impact of the current effect in the coming year. if the problem continues and the default rate increased we will use the dividend as compensation for the loss that is why we said the profitability of banks is crucial for the country’s economy,” he added.
bankers said that even though the government put pressure on banks it is acceptable. “it is a behavior of poor country and government. since it does not have a capacity it is looking on the better actors of the economy.”"
"five international air transport and tourism bodies have launched an appeal to international financial institutions, country development partners and international donors to support africa’s travel and tourism sector which employs some 24.6 million people on the african continent. without urgent funding, the covid-19 crisis could see a collapse of the sector in africa, taking with it millions of jobs. the sector contributes $169 billion to africa’s economy combined, representing 7.1% of the continent’s gdp.
the request is being made by the international air transport association (iata), the world tourism organization (unwto) of the united nations, the world travel and tourism council (wttc), the african airlines association (afraa) and the airlines association of southern africa (aasa).
these organizations are jointly calling on international financial institutions, country development partners and international donors to support the african travel and tourism sector through these tough times by providing usd 10 billion in relief to support the travel and tourism industry and help protect the livelihoods of those it supports directly and indirectly; access to as much grant-type financing and cash flow assistance as possible to inject liquidity and provide targeted support to severely impacted countries; financial measures that can help minimize disruptions to much-needed credit and liquidity for businesses including the deferral of existing financial obligations or loan repayments; and ensuring that all funds flow down immediately to save the businesses that need them urgently, with minimal application processes and without impediment from normal lending considerations such as creditworthiness.
“the impact of the covid-19 pandemic is being felt across the whole tourism value chain. the sector and the millions of livelihoods it supports across the world, including vulnerable communities are particularly exposed. international financial support is key to ensuring that tourism can lead to wider economic and social recovery in these communities,” said unwto secretary-general, zurab pololikashvili.
some african governments are trying to provide targeted and temporary support for hard-hit sectors such as travel and tourism. however, many countries lack the necessary resources to help the industry and the livelihoods it supports through this crisis.
“airlines are at the core of the travel and tourism value chain that has created quality jobs for 24.6 million people in africa. their livelihoods are at risk. containing the pandemic is the top priority. but without a lifeline of funding to keep the travel and tourism sector alive, the economic devastation of covid-19 could take africa’s development back a decade or more. financial relief today is a critical investment in africa’s post-pandemic future for millions of africans,” said iata’s director-general and ceo, alexandre de juniac.
“the situation is now critical. airlines, hotels, guesthouses, lodges, restaurants, meeting venues and related businesses face mounting losses. typically, tourism is comprised of 80% of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). to preserve cash, many have already begun laying off or placing staff on unpaid leave,” a statement from iata reads.
“the travel and tourism sector is in a fight for survival, with over 100 million jobs losses globally and nearly eight million in africa alone due to the covid-19 crisis. travel and tourism is the backbone of many economies across africa and its collapse will lead to hundreds of millions of livelihoods being impacted and enormous financial pressure for years to come. now, more than ever, it is vital that governments work together on a global coordinated approach towards a swift recovery and ongoing support for travel and tourism. it is critical that the most vulnerable communities receive international help. the speed and strength with which the international community comes together and responds through international financial institutions, country development partners and international donors will be paramount to provide support to the many millions of people whose livelihoods are heavily dependent on our sector,” added gloria guevara, wttc president and ceo.
“air transport and tourism industries are among the worst impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. air transport is critical for the economic development and integration of the african continent. as such, support to the airline industry will aid in a faster economic recovery. an end of operations by african airlines would trigger a host of serious financial consequences, while replacing the air service provided by the airlines would be a challenging and costly process. urgent, immediate and consistent measures need to be taken for the survival and rebound of the industry,” said afraa secretary-general, abdérahmane berthé.
“the impact of covid-19 in africa continues to be brutal. air travel and tourism have essentially shut down. now, more than ever, international countries need to come together to help those communities that are most vulnerable. the survival of our industry and its allied sectors has serious ramifications for africa’s entire air transport system,” said aasa ceo, chris zweigenthal."
"eighty-three thousand to 190 000 people in africa could die of covid-19 and 29 million to 44 million could get infected in the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, a new study by the world health organization (who) regional office for africa finds. the research, which is based on prediction modelling, looks at 47 countries in the who african region with a total population of one billion.
the new estimates are based on modifying the risk of transmission and disease severity by variables specific to each country in order to adjust for the unique nature of the region. the model predicts the observed slower rate of transmission, lower age of people with severe disease and lower mortality rates compared to what is seen in the most affected countries in the rest of the world. this is largely driven by social and environmental factors slowing the transmission, and a younger population that has benefitted from the control of communicable diseases such as hiv and tuberculosis to reduce possible vulnerabilities.
the lower rate of transmission, however, suggests a more prolonged outbreak over a few years, according to the study which also revealed that smaller african countries alongside algeria, south africa and cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not prioritized.
“while covid-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will smoulder in transmission hotspots,” said dr matshidiso moeti, the who regional director for africa. “covid-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. we need to test, trace, isolate and treat.”
the predicted number of cases that would require hospitalization would overwhelm the available medical capacity in much of africa. there would be an estimated 3.6 million-5.5 million covid-19 hospitalizations, of which 82,000-167,000 would be severe cases requiring oxygen, and 52,000-107,000 would be critical cases requiring breathing support. such a huge number of patients in hospitals would severely strain the health capacities of countries.
a survey of health services in the african region undertaken in march 2020 based on self-reports by 47 countries to who revealed that there were on average nine intensive care unit beds. these would be woefully inadequate. additionally, the physical access to these services to the general population is very low, suggesting many people would not even have the chance to get to the needed care. diseases that could be managed could easily become more complicated as a result.
the study recommends that countries across africa need to expand the capacity particularly of primary hospitals and ensure that basic emergency care is included in primary health systems.
“the importance of promoting effective containment measures is ever more crucial, as sustained and widespread transmission of the virus could severely overwhelm our health systems,” said dr moeti. “curbing a largescale outbreak is far costlier than the ongoing preventive measures governments are undertaking to contain the spread of the virus.”
containment measures, specifically physical distancing and hygiene improvement, aim to slow down the transmission of the virus so its effects happen at a rate manageable by the health system.
all countries in the who african region are using these results through the who country offices to inform their containment actions. the detailed methods and results are currently in press at the british medical journal-global health after extensive peer review and validation.
dr moeti announced these new projections during the who africa media leader virtual press conference today which was held with the support of the world economic forum. the other speakers were dr amit thakker, executive chairman of africa health business and president of the africa healthcare federation and stephen karingi, director of regional trade and integration, economic commission for africa."
"the 2020 world press freedom index, compiled by reporters without borders (rsf), shows that the coming decade will be decisive for the future of journalism, with the covid-19 pandemic highlighting and amplifying the many crises that threaten the right to freely reported, independent, diverse and reliable information.ethiopia has risen 11 places up on the 2020 world press freedom index, and now ranks 99th among 180 countries that most respect freedom of information.
published annually by reporters without borders (rsf), a non-governmental organisation based in paris, the index evaluates the level of freedom available to the media throughout the world.
ethiopia was 110 in 2019 world press freedom ranking. this year, the country achieved a score of 32.82, which was 35.11 in 2019.
norway has topped the annual press freedom index for the fourth consecutive year scoring 7.84.
finland retained its second place, while denmark moved up two places to round out the top three at the expense of sweden and the netherlands, which both dropped a place to fourth and fifth respectively because of an “increase in cyber-harassment.”
published every year for almost two decades, the ranking rates 180 countries and territories based on “the level of pluralism, media independence, self-censorship, legal framework, and transparency,” according to rsf.
the results are “calculated from responses to a questionnaire that is completed by experts throughout the world, supported by a qualitative analysis.”
north korea dropped to last place in the table, usurping turkmenistan, while eritrea, which lies in 178th, is still the county with the least press freedom in africa.
malaysia, in 101st position, up 22, and the maldives, in 79th place, up 19, had the biggest rises in comparison with last year’s index. rsf cited “beneficial effects of changes of government” in the respective nations.
the report further states that there is a “clear correlation between suppression of media freedom in response to the coronavirus pandemic and a country’s ranking.”
both china, 177th, and iran, down three to 173rd, censored their covid-19 outbreaks “extensively.” in iraq, down six spots to come in at 162 in the press freedom index, the authorities recently stripped news agency reuters of its licence for three months after it published an article questioning official covid-19 numbers in the middle eastern country.
the 2020 edition of the index, which evaluates the situation for journalists each year, suggests that the next ten years will be pivotal for press freedom because of converging crises affecting the future of journalism: a geopolitical crisis (due to the aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes); a technological crisis (due to a lack of democratic guarantees); a democratic crisis (due to polarisation and repressive policies); a crisis of trust (due to suspicion and even hatred of the media); and an economic crisis (impoverishing quality journalism).
these five areas of crisis – the effects of which the index’s methodology allows us to evaluate – are now compounded by a global public health crisis.
“we are entering a decisive decade for journalism linked to crises that affect its future,” rsf secretary-general christophe deloire said. “the coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor. what will freedom of information, pluralism and reliability look like in 2030? the answer to that question is being determined today.”"
"when covid-19 emerged as a global health threat, african countries were quick to enact public health measures to slow the spread of the virus. now as some countries begin to ease lockdowns, it is important to maintain strong surveillance, case finding and testing among other control measures to halt the pandemic.
“national and regional lockdowns have helped to slow down the spread of covid, but it remains a considerable public health threat,” said dr matshidiso moeti, the world health organization (who) regional director for africa. “lockdowns are being eased in some parts of africa, but we cannot just revert back to how things were before the outbreak. if governments abruptly end these measures, we risk losing the gains countries have made so far against covid-19.”
africa has to date recorded more than 36,000 confirmed cases of covid-19 and over 1,500 deaths. west and central africa are regions of concern. so far there are 11,000 cases in west and central africa, and 300 people have died. in the week of 13 april, cases increased by 113% in central africa and 42% in west africa.
however, the worst fears of public health officials and governments have not yet come to pass. africa has so far been spared an explosion in covid-19 case numbers. prompt action by governments to implement lockdowns and physical distancing, alongside effective public health measures to test, trace and treat have slowed down the spread of the virus.
the first country to implement a lockdown in the who african region was rwanda on 21 march, since then 11 countries have followed. a further 10 have instituted partial lockdowns of cities or high risk communities.
preliminary data indicate that countries that implemented nationwide lockdowns found that the weekly increase in the number of new cases fell significantly from a 67% rise in the first week after the lockdown to a 27% rise in the second week. furthermore, the initial analysis indicates that countries which implemented partial and targeted lockdowns along with effective public health measures may have been even more effective at slowing down the virus.
“we are still analysing the data. if further research corroborates our initial findings that targeted lockdowns, based on data and accompanied by public health measures contribute to flattening the covid-19 curve, this could help balance the huge social costs of these measures for countries,” said dr moeti.
countries are now starting to relax their confinement measures. ghana was the first to lift its partial lockdown in accra and kumasi. however, other restrictions are in place, and the government has stressed that the end of the lockdown does not mean the end of the pandemic. while some essential businesses are being opened, mass gatherings are still not permitted and restrictions on the number of passengers on public transport services remain in place.
the government is continuing to monitor events in covid-19 hotspots and has stated it will re-establish localized lockdowns if needed. ghana is also averaging around 30 covid-19 tests per 10,000 people per day – the highest in west africa. south africa is also considering easing its confinement measures and has scaled up its testing efforts. despite progress on testing for covid-19, countries in the who african region are averaging nine tests per 10 000 people."
"a global report on food crises released by united nations has stated that more people face acute food insecurity and malnutrition in the wake of the covid-19.
the report indicated that at the close of 2019, 135 million people across 55 countries and territories experienced acute food insecurity, noting that additionally, in the 55 food-crisis countries, 75 million children were stunted.
this, according to the report was the highest level of acute food insecurity and malnutrition documented by the network since the first edition of the report in 2017.
the report by the global network against food crises, an international alliance of united nation, governmental, and non-governmental agencies working to address the root causes of extreme hunger.
the 2020 annual global report on food crises, showed also that in 2019, 183 million people were classified to be in stressed condition – at the cusp of acute hunger and at risk of slipping into crisis or worse if faced with a shock or stressor, such as the covid-19 pandemic.
it added also that about 73 million of the 135 million people covered by the report live in africa; 43 million live in the middle east and asia; 18.5 million live in latin america and the caribbean.
the key drivers behind the trends analysed were: conflict – the key factor that pushed 77 million people into acute food insecurity; weather extreme – affecting 34 million people; and economic turbulence which accounted for 24 million.
ethiopia
for ethiopia the report states that while ethiopia has made development gains over the last two decades, 27 percent of the population, or 30.2 million people, were still living below the poverty line (usd 1.90 a day).
the report also states that over 70 percent of rural ethiopians are severely poor according to the multidimensional poverty index. “frequent and severe droughts have eroded resilience for rural households that have lost productive assets and have had little time for recovery between drought events,” reads the report.
the report also states that about 8 million people were in crisis or worse across afar, amhara, oromiya, southern nations, nationalities and peoples’ region (snnpr), somali and tigray regions from july–september 2019, despite receiving humanitarian food assistance. this includes about 1.9 million in emergency of whom over 1 million were in oromiya. around a third of the population in somali and oromiya faced crisis or worse. an additional 10 million people were classified in stressed level.
the population in crisis or worse was similar to that of 2018, when estimated that 8.1 million people were food insecure and in need of assistance. at the start of meher harvests in october 2019, food security improved, but about 6.7 million people remained in crisis or worse.
ethiopia is also the second largest host of refugees in africa. the result of the annual report indicated that monthly food assistance for refugees lasted from 14–25 days, creating food gaps for up to 17 days a month.
stating the factors driving acute food insecurity the report pointed out that extreme weather and crop pests contributed to the low yield.
the february-may belg rainy season was characterized by late onset, erratic distribution and below-average rains. a below-average secondary belg season harvest in eastern amhara, eastern oromiya and north-eastern snnp regions was expected. in east and west harerghe zones, where no significant rains were received until april and seasonal cumulative precipitations were up to 60 percent below average, the cereal output was very poor, with crop failures reported in some areas. in western key-producing areas, the june–september kiremt rains were up to 30 percent above average and aggregate cereal production is estimated at above-average levels. however, unseasonal heavy rains during the october/november harvest resulted in localized crop production shortfalls. crops were attacked by desert locusts at the end of the year in northern and south-eastern tigray, north-eastern amhara and eastern oromiya regions. while coordinated control measures implemented by farmers, local communities and the government have contained crop losses, substantial localized losses were reported in parts of oromiya zone."
"public health systems in africa are coming under severe strain as the unprecedented covid-19 pandemic persists. but as countries battle to bring the outbreak under control, efforts must also be maintained on other health emergencies and progress made against diseases such as malaria or polio preserved, the world health organization (who) urged.
prior to the arrival of the novel coronavirus in africa, who was stressing the need for countries to ensure the continuity of routine essential health services. “an overburdened health system not only undermines the effectiveness of the response to covid-19 but may also undermine the response to a whole host of preventable threats to human health. even brief interruptions of vaccination make outbreaks more likely to occur, putting children and other vulnerable groups more at risk of life-threatening diseases” who said in a statement.
“i urge all countries to not lose focus on their gains made in health as they adapt to tackle this new threat,” said dr matshidiso moeti, who regional director for africa. “we saw with the ebola virus disease outbreak in west africa that we lost more people to malaria, for instance than, we lost to the ebola outbreak. let us not repeat that with covid-19.”
confirmed covid-19 cases in africa continue to rise, now exceeding 28,000. who is supporting countries in all aspects of the covid-19 response and has recently published guidelines for ensuring the continuation of critical health services, including immunization and anti-malaria campaigns. the guidelines stress the need for countries to take a dynamic approach that mitigates any unavoidable pause in vaccination campaigns.
the consequences of disrupting efforts to control malaria in africa could be particularly grave. current estimates suggest that sub-saharan africa accounted for approximately 93% of all malaria cases and 94% of deaths, mainly among children under five. a new analysis by who and partners suggests that in a worst case scenario if malaria prevention and treatment services were severely disrupted as a result of covid-19, the number of malaria deaths in 2020 in sub-saharan africa could rise to double the number in 2018.
“africa has made significant progress over the past 20 years in stopping malaria from claiming lives. while covid-19 is a major health threat, it’s critical to maintain malaria prevention and treatment programmes. the new modelling shows deaths could exceed 700 000 this year alone. we haven’t seen mortality levels like that in 20 years. we must not turn back the clock,” said dr moeti.
there are countries like benin, the democratic republic of the congo, sierra leone, chad, central african republic, uganda and tanzania which are continuing with their insecticide treated bed net campaigns and other important malaria prevention activities. countries are adapting their malaria strategies to the current complex situation.
another essential health service is immunization. the response to covid-19 has already disrupted vaccination efforts on the continent. despite considerable progress on immunization, one in four african children remain under-immunized. measles vaccination campaigns in chad, ethiopia, nigeria and south sudan have already been suspended because of covid-19, leaving approximately 21 million children who would have otherwise been vaccinated unprotected."
"in a live poll conducted by africa.com on april 22 as part of its webinar series, crisis management for african business leaders, which capital is the official media partner, nearly 70% of webinar participants predicted that their business revenue will decrease by more than 10% next month. 47% indicated that they expect their revenue to decrease by more than 25% next month, and 24% indicated that they expect revenues to decrease by more than 50% next month. only 20% indicated that they expect revenue to remain the same or increase.
approximately 1,500 business leaders participated in the poll. participants came from 41 countries across the african continent, with the largest representation coming from nigeria, followed by south africa, kenya, ghana and ethiopia. 60% of the participants have one of the following titles: ceo, managing director, president, principal, partner, cfo, chair, chief, director, executive director, group head, general manager, or manager. of the remaining 40%, the leading titles are analyst and consultant.
the largest sectors represented are financial services and professional services, followed by energy and manufacturing. a smaller tier consisted of real estate, health care, agriculture, health care, and media, arts & entertainment.
the live poll preceded a panel discussion on liquidity – managing cash flow when sources of revenue and funding dry up moderated by kunle elebute, chair, kpmg, with the following panelists: welela dawit, cfo, ge; admassu tadesse, president and chief executive of the eastern and southern african trade and development bank (tdb); and sim tshabalala, chief executive, standard bank group.
africa.com chair and ceo teresa clarke commented “the poll results are supported by the qualitative data we collected from the 10,000 registrants for the webinar series. we asked registrants what their greatest concern is with respect to covid-19. responses were open ended, and we received 10,000 responses ranging from 10-100 words. by far, the greatest concern expressed was reduction in revenue. but interestingly, many commented that while they were concerned about revenues, it was because they were concerned about being able to pay their employees. one respondent commented, ‘in africa, we care more about people than profits.’”
the panel discussion is part of a four part series on crisis management developed by africa.com and three faculty members from harvard business school. the next webinar discussion will take place on wednesday, april 29, and is moderated by hakeem belo-osagie, chair of fsdh merchant bank and harvard business school senior lecturer of business administration. that webinar is entitled “this isn’t the west – how africa’s informal sector reacts to covid-19.”"
"century mall and its sister companies’ has provided close to 26.2 million birr for the effort to fight the covid 19.
the administration of the company that represented other sister companies such as steely rmi besides the mall stated that the support is in cash and in kind.
in its statement century mall disclosed that from the different kind of donation 3.3 million birr worth of 1,500 quintal wheat flour is provided for addis ababa city administration and bishoftu city administration.
from the stated amount of flour 500 quintal is provided for bishoftu in a ceremony held on april 15 in the presence of the mayor of bishoftu city administration, alemtsehay shiferaw.
the mayor said that steely rmi is a symbol on taking corporate social responsibility in the town that it provided several infrastructures including school, health facility and water for the community in bishoftu.
she said that the current support for the society is very big in volume and that others should follow.
at the same day the company has provided the 1,000 quintal flour at the food bank at exhibition centre for the addis ababa city administration.
it has also provided one million birr cash for ministry of peace that is the hub for mobilizing national resource to fight covid 19 in addition to donation of over 421 thousand birr collected from its employees and management staff of century mall and sister companies.
according to the statement the company sent to capital it has decided to provide a four-storey building, which has 5.5 million birr annual rental revenue, for the government to use it until the current challenge is fully controlled.
the statement that appreciated the effort of health workers and the government to fight the global pandemic has also provided toyota land curser with a driver and fuel cost for the government for unlimited period of time on the aim to transport health workers.
“considering the effect of the virus on the economic activity of the country century mall has decided to cut half of the three months rental fee for 226 tenants that host shops, restaurants and cafeteria, supermarkets and other facilities in the building. the total rental fee cut is worth 16.2 million birr,” it added."
"the international air transport association (iata) now forecasts airlines will lose $314 billion in passenger revenue this year amid the coronavirus outbreak, a deepening of $62 billion from its previous projection.
the new forecast equates to carriers’ 2020 passenger revenue being down 55% on 2019’s figure, and reflects worsening economic forecasts and predictions that the return to air travel is likely to be slower than previously expected.
the lower revenue in the new forecast is based on a projected 48% fall in traffic measured in rpks for the full year, iata states.
“we have never seen a downturn this deep before,” says iata director general alexandre de juniac. ”in our latest scenario, full-year passenger revenues plummet 55% compared to 2019, while traffic falls 48%. in other words, half our business disappears. that’s catastrophic.”
iata’s previous forecast – released on 24 march – predicted a $252 billion, or 44%, hit to passenger revenues and a 38% reduction in rpks.
most regions will see full-year rpks down by around 50% year on year, iata now predicts, with the north american sector being the outlier at around 36%.
the asia-pacific region accounts for $113 billion of the lost passenger revenue, followed by europe with $89 billion and north america with $64 billion.
the airline body’s revision of its 2020 revenue projection was partly prompted by a steeper-than-expected reduction in worldwide flights leading into the second quarter, which iata expects to be the height of the crisis. it had earlier forecast a fall in flights of around 65% year on year at that point, but by early april flights were down 80%, with the industry being “virtually grounded” aside from domestic markets in the usa and asia.
among its other revised considerations are a worsening economic outlook, including a projection that global gdp will fall by nearly 6% this year – twice as large as the contraction seen during the global financial crisis.
amid that economic pressure, iata expects the restart of travel in the second half of 2020 to be slower than previously forecast, driven in part by a slow return to international flights.
domestic markets are forecast to return ahead of international markets, but will still be dampened by poorer-than-expected economic conditions.
iata notes that while domestic markets accounted for 58% of passenger numbers in 2019, international flights accounted for 67% of traffic measured in rpks – reflecting the latter’s importance to airlines.
the recession alone would push global rpks down 8% in the third quarter, iata notes, before travel restrictions and the confidence effects of the coronavirus outbreak are considered.
even amid a recovery in traffic beginning in the third quarter, global rpks are still predicted to be down 33% in the fourth quarter of this year.
iata also notes that its revised assessment reflects a much deeper impact on markets in africa and south america than previously expected.
its forecast continues to be based on severe domestic travel restrictions lasting for the three months that make up 2020’s second quarter, with some curbs on international travel extending beyond that period."
"millions of farmers across africa are facing economic devastation as covid-19 pandemic disrupts exports and global food supply chains according to the impact of coronavirus on africa’s agriculture april 2020 report released by selina wamucii that gives a most-recent and ground-up perspective on how the pandemic is affecting african farmers.
according to john oroko, ceo of selina wamucii, intra-africa trade is around 2% while exports from africa to the rest of the world range from 80% to 90% of total exports, of which a huge share is made up of agricultural produce.
“the covid-19 pandemic has unfortunately come at a time when our farmers depend largely on exports to markets outside the continent and also before the commencement of trading under the african continental free trade area (afcfta) that was scheduled to commence on july 1, 2020, thereby creating a single continental market of more than 1.3 billion people. now, unlike no other time, we can see a demonstration of why the success of the african continental free trade area will be directly linked to securing the livelihoods of african farmers in the future,” says oroko. “covid–19 is severely disrupting trade in key markets for africa’s agricultural produce and african farmers are bound to experience a nightmare in export market access,” adds oroko.
african farmers are a relatively elderly demographic and 70% of africa’s food is currently produced by women, who are also primary caregivers across many of africa’s rural regions. this means therefore that a key segment of the farmers in the region is also at a higher risk of contracting covid–19. morocco tops the list of african countries whose agricultural exports face the highest risk largely due to the country’s over-reliance on the european market given its close proximity and well-established traditional trading ties.
in 2018, morocco’s ffv, fish, seafood and cut flowers, worth $3 billion was exported to the european union, translating into over 78% of the ffv, fish, seafood and cut flowers worth $3,846,083 exported by morocco to the rest of the world in that year.
kenya’s agricultural exports also face a great risk mainly due to the over-reliance on fresh-cut flower exports, the bulk of which end up in the european union. additionally, over 50% of kenya’s ffv exports and nuts go to the european union and china, which are markets that have already been shaken up. in 2018, kenya’s ffv and nut’ exports worth $223,113,000, out of the total $482,559,000 exported, went to european markets. before the covid–19 pandemic, farmers in kenya and other east africa countries were already suffering severe locust invasion and now covid–19 has worsened the situation.
the u.n. food and agriculture organization (fao) has warned that a new wave of locust swarms are starting to form, representing an unprecedented threat to farmer livelihoods – specifically in kenya, ethiopia, and somalia. as a result, farmers are facing a double catastrophe from the impact of covid–19 and the locusts at the same time, a combination that will negatively affect their farm yields."
"chinese ambassador meets african union deputy chairperson over the attack a spike in racial discrimination in china prompted by fears over the covid-19 pandemic has led some in the african diapora to reevaluate the relationship between the african continent and beijing.
over the past week, footage has been published on social media showing africans in the southern chinese city of guangzhou being evicted from their apartments, refused access to hotels or restaurants, and being forced to sleep on the streets. these incidents occurred ostensibly as part of efforts to halt the spread of covid-19 in the country but have led to a diplomatic crisis between beijing and african nations.
the images sparked outrage across africa, with the hashtag #chinamustexplain trending on twitter and chinese ambassadors being summoned by irate officials in nigeria and ghana, to name but a few. african ambassadors in china wrote to the foreign minister of china over what they called the “stigmatisation and discrimination” being faced by their citizens.
following the reported incidents of brutalities and related injuries allegedly inflicted on africans in guangdong province in china, the deputy chairperson of the african union commission, kwesi quartey called the chinese ambassador to the african union, liu yuxi, to the commission for a discussion on how the matter would be resolved.
‘quartey informed yuxi that given the closeness of the relations between china and africa, the reported incidences were clearly unacceptable,’ according to a statement from the au.
in his response, ‘yuxi reiterated the immense value china places on its relationship with africa and china’s commitment to protecting and developing this relationship. he registered the regret and embarrassment that the incidents have caused china. yuxi recounted steps the government of china has taken, and continues to take to restore calm and to protect the safety, security and dignity of the african population in china,’ the statement reads.
yuxi also informed the deputy chairperson that, the chinese whose social media post caused the unfortunate incident has been arrested. also, law enforcement personnel exerting excessive force have been reprimanded and cautioned to exercise restraint whilst discharging their duties. he also mentioned that two hotels have been secured for the affected africans and the cost would be borne by the chinese government. furthermore, seized passports and personal belongings have been retrieved and handed over to their rightful owners, yuxi added.
‘clearly this matter has caused grief, pain and humiliation to all africans,’ a tweet reads.
‘africa values its relationship with china but not at any price. further act of brutality meted out to africans will not be countenanced by the african union and indeed all africans,’ another tweet reads.
beijing initially chose to dismiss and deny the accounts of unfair treatment.
“we do not have discrimination in china against african brothers,” foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian said on monday. he then accused the united states of trying to exploit the issue to undermine china’s relations with africa. the statement came after a group of african ambassadors in beijing expressed concern over numerous reports of africans being forced into quarantine or being singled out for scrutiny by health authorities.
the tone then appeared to soften, as china’s foreign minister wang yi spoke on the phone with moussa faki mahamat, the chairperson of the african union commission, with wang assuring mahamat that measures were being taken to improve the situation of africans in guanghzou. mahamat later described the relationship between china and africa in a tweet as being “strong and brotherly”. it now appears that most of the displaced africans in guangzhou have found places to stay and that city authorities are engaging in consultations with the african community as well as academics to repair the relationship.
on monday, ambassadors and envoys from more than 20 african nations met with china’s assistant minister of foreign affairs, chen xiaodong. chen vowed to lift the health measures aimed at african residents except for those with confirmed cases of covid-19, afp reported.
over the past 20 years, china has become an increasingly influential presence on the continent as africa’s natural resources have helped fuel the country’s meteoric economic development. according to data from johns hopkins university, the chinese government as well as its banks and companies have lent some $143 billion to africa between 2000 and 2017, often to finance large infrastructure projects. recent estimates put the number of chinese citizens currently residing in africa at one million while some 200,000 africans live and work in china.key facts"
"as part of its analysis to inform covid-19 policy responses, the economic commission for africa, is calling for adequate consideration of the vulnerability of city economies as african governments consolidate efforts and define stimulus measures to mitigate national and regional economic impacts.
“as engines and drivers of economic growth, cities face considerable risks in light of covid-19 with implications for the continent’s resilience to the pandemic,” states thokozile ruzvidzo director of the gender, poverty and social policy division of the eca.
africa’s cities are home to 600 million people and account for more than 50% of the region’s gdp. this is even higher at more than 70% for countries such as botswana, uganda, tunisia and kenya. a third of national gpd (31%) comes on average from the largest city in african countries. as such, the economic contribution of cities in the region is far higher than their share of population.
covid-19 employment effects in are likely to be severe in urban areas. with urban-based sectors of the economy (manufacturing and services) which currently account for 64% of gdp in africa are expected to be hit hard by covid-19 related effects, leading to substantial losses in productive jobs. in particular, the approximately 250 million africans in informal urban employment (excluding north africa) will be at risk. firms and businesses in african cities are highly vulnerable to covid-19 related effects, especially smes which account for 80% of employment in africa. these risks are compounded by a likely hike in the cost of living is expected as shown for example by some initial reports of up to 100% increase in the price of some food items in some african cities.
additionally, urban consumption and expenditure (of food, manufactured goods, utilities, transport, energy and services) is likely to experience a sharp fall in light of covid-related lockdowns and reduced restrictions.
“africa’s cities drive consumption with their growing middle class with per capita consumption spending in large cities being on average 80 per cent higher at the city level than at the national level. covid-19 related decline in urban consumption will thus impact domestic value chains, including rural areas,” notes ruzvidzo.
further, with the per capita expenditure of african local authorities being the lowest in the world at $26, many local authorities are poorly resourced and less able to contend with the onslaught of covid-19. alarming also the likely fall in revenue streams for local authorities due to covid-19 curtailing their already limited ability to respond to this crisis. intergovernmental/national transfers which account for 70 to 80 per cent of local authorities’ finance are likely to be reduced due to immediate national response and recovery requirements. own source revenues which are already low at only 10% of local authorities’ finances with city level lockdowns and restrictions leading to reduced economic activity.
yet, local authorities are frontline responders to such shocks and crises. given the proximity to their constituencies, local authorities are well positioned to and already do lead responses to some of the immediate effects, and doing so have a better understanding of needs and necessary measures, and enable higher transparency of accountability.
in light of these circumstances, eca is proposing specific support to city governments to mitigate and respond to the economic effects of covid-19, in addition to the immediate health and humanitarian focus. disaggregating the analysis and identification of priorities and responses at the sub-national and city scales is a first step.
proactive measures are also needed for urban economic recovery including through measures to boost finances and capacities of local authorities as first responders, short term bailouts and exemptions for smes to limit productivity and employment loses, social protection for those in informal urban employment while anticipating the potential of labour intensive public work programs for job creation in the medium term. in this regard, ms. ruzvidzo emphasizes that “local governments must be supported because they are better able to respond to local needs including in coordination with community-based structures”.
in the longer term, the acute vulnerability of city economies calls for efforts to revitalize and enhance the productivity of africa’s cities through adequate investments to address the substantial deficits and barriers they face. with more than half of africa’s population expected to live in cities in just 15 years, the risks of poorly planned and managed urbanization are considerably high, rendering millions vulnerable to the effects of future shocks."
"personal services sectors such as tourism, hospitality and retail at a standstill due to drastic measures taken in the fight against covid-19the covid-19 pandemic has dealt a heavier blow to personal services sectors compared with other recent economic crises, an unctad analysis shows.
the pandemic has massively disrupted key services sectors, especially tourism, hospitality and retail. this contrasts with the resilience witnessed during the 2008 great recession and the 2011-2013 eurozone sovereign debt crisis, particularly in comparison to trade in goods.
an unctad survey found that in the eurozone, the purchasing managers index (pmi) indicator, a measure of prevailing economic trends, in services and the composite pmi both contracted from above 50 points in january to minus 28.4 and minus 31.4 respectively by mid-march.
3the drastic but necessary social distancing and lockdown measures adopted in the eurozone in the last month,” said pamela coke-hamilton, director of unctad’s international trade division.
personal services sector nearly destroyed
the strict measures deployed to combat the pandemic have nearly destroyed personal service sectors such as tourism, hospitality and transport.
millions of economically vulnerable people in developing countries are reeling under the crushing weight of the measures, as these sectors absorb a large share of low-wage, low-skilled and part-time workers, many of whom are women.
“if the crisis persists, the whole tourism industry as we know it in developing countries may collapse,” ms. coke-hamilton warned. women represent more than half of the workers (54% in 2019) in the industry worldwide.
restrictions on flights and on ships entering ports, have also affected remittances, a lifeline for millions in developing countries.
according to the world bank, remittances were set to surpass foreign direct investment in 2019 to reach $550 billion, but both are likely to drop significantly in 2020 due to the pandemic.
countries such as the philippines, which relies heavily on remittances from its diaspora working in the personal services sector, along with 7 million tourists annually, may be particularly hard hit.
other countries where remittances represent a high share of gdp, such as kyrgyzstan (35%), tonga (33%) and tajikistan (31%), will also be severely affected.
windfall for ict services
in contrast to covid-19’s debilitating impact on personal services, the pandemic has handed a windfall opportunity to services powered by information and communication technology (ict).
they include services enabling teleworking, video streaming, gaming and e-commerce platforms.
the rapid growth of these “impersonal” services is being mostly felt in developed countries, as they boast widespread and higher quality ict services.
“nevertheless, this boom will not compensate for the loss of income from personal services sectors, especially in developing countries,” coke-hamilton said.
policy coordination needed at all levels
to address the economic fallout from covid-19, thematic policy coordination is needed nationally and globally, coke-hamilton underscored.
she said health policies should be devised and applied in tandem with macroeconomic, trade and finance policies in a holistic approach.
this is critical in the services sector, which relies on a coherent mix of policies and regulations between the sector and those in trade, investment, competition, industrial, social and other areas.
“given that strict mitigation measures remain in place as countries battle the pandemic, government programmes to support furloughed or unemployed people through direct payments can help protect vulnerable workers from services sectors,” ms. coke-hamilton said.
governments should cast their nets wider to support the 164 million migrant workers worldwide, many of whom are women, working in personal services sectors, she added.
such support may include providing them with secure access to financial services for sending remittances or giving them short-term loans.
looking ahead, as developing countries continue to nurture exports of personal services as an important source of income, they need to fast-track and upgrade skills in knowledge-intensive ones suach as those powered by ict.
“this will create jobs that are not just formal, qualified and high-quality, but also resilient,” coke-hamilton concluded."
"ethiopian airlines is asking employees to take unpaid leave. the request comes as ethiopia reports its first death from covid-19. permanent staff members are being asked to take all their annual leave and up to 90 days of unpaid leave.
according to sources close to the case, the airline is asking them to take unpaid leave for three months starting from april to july.
due to the high spread of the virus there is a worldwide fear of travel and governments are banning their citizens to move from one part of the world to the other. the airline has down sized 90 percent of its passenger’s destinations, and announced 550 million dollar loss in revenue.
on tuesday april 7, 2020 as stated by tewolde gebremariam the ceo of the airline, due to the covid 19 the global attacking pandemic, the airline has downsize more than 90 percent of the international flights, and serving revenue losses in millions of dollars, but “the airline will not decrease its employees, although the air line will negotiation with its employees to take unpaid leave,” he said.
“most of the international airway companies are laying off their employees because of their loss with the impact of the virus from low percentage of passengers, but ethiopian airlines will face everything with its employees” said tewolde. ethiopian airlines has and will lay off only temporary employees under an agreement made with their recruitment agencies.
“most of the airlines are calling on governments to provide immediate financial aid to help airlines to remain viable businesses and able to lead the recovery when the pandemic is contained,” said tewolde adding that ethiopian air lines is not in that level of challenge, and still has the capacity to remain in the business as it was before.
one month ago the airline has been asking its employees to take a special leave scheme in a specific set of time due to lack of international flights and also aiming to minimize social distance.
according to the ceo, the first batch of 526 employees who took this special annual leave will be back on april 22 and then the airline will wait until then to decide on the issue.
however as sources told capital the airline has already started to call its employees to take the unpaid leave.
ethiopian airlines is one of the big international airline groups and has more than 16,000 employees both permanent and temporary.
“the corona virus is a huge challenge” however he said, “we are certain other experiences help us to minimize the outcome, it is a temporary problem we have a capacity to recover” said the ceo.
according to the international air transport association due to the spread and restriction of travels globally more than 25 million jobs that are directly related to the aviation industry bare at risk of disappearing, which two million of them are in africa."
"growth in sub-saharan africa has been significantly impacted by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and is forecast to fall sharply from 2.4% in 2019 to -2.1 to -5.1% in 2020, the first recession in the region over the past 25 years, according to the latest africa’s pulse, the world bank’s twice-yearly economic update for the region.
“the covid-19 pandemic is testing the limits of societies and economies across the world, and african countries are likely to be hit particularly hard,” said hafez ghanem, world bank vice president for africa. “we are rallying all possible resources to help countries meet people’s immediate health and survival needs while also safeguarding livelihoods and jobs in the longer term – including calling for a standstill on official bilateral debt service payments which would free up funds for strengthening health systems to deal with covid 19 and save lives, social safety nets to save livelihoods and help workers who lose jobs, support to small and medium enterprises, and food security.”
the pulse authors recommend that african policymakers focus on saving lives and protecting livelihoods by focusing on strengthening health systems and taking quick actions to minimize disruptions in food supply chains. they also recommend implementing social protection programs, including cash transfers, food distribution and fee waivers, to support citizens, especially those working in the informal sector.
the analysis shows that covid-19 will cost the region between $37 billion and $79 billion in output losses for 2020 due to a combination of effects. they include trade and value chain disruption, which impacts commodity exporters and countries with strong value chain participation; reduced foreign financing flows from remittances, tourism, foreign direct investment, foreign aid, combined with capital flight; and through direct impacts on health systems, and disruptions caused by containment measures and the public response.
while most countries in the region have been affected to different degrees by the pandemic, real gross domestic product growth is projected to fall sharply particularly in the region’s three largest economies – nigeria, angola, and south africa- as a result of persistently weak growth and investment. in general, oil exporting-countries will also be hard-hit; while growth is also expected to weaken substantially in the two fastest growing areas-the west african economic and monetary union and the east african community-due to weak external demand, disruptions to supply chains and domestic production. the region’s tourism sector is expected to contract sharply due to severe disruption to travel.
the covid-19 crisis also has the potential to spark a food security crisis in africa, with agricultural production potentially contracting between 2.6% in an optimistic scenario and up to 7% if there are trade blockages. food imports would decline substantially (as much as 25% or as little as 13%) due to a combination of higher transaction costs and reduced domestic demand.
several african countries have reacted quickly and decisively to curb the potential influx and spread of the coronavirus, very much in line with international guidelines. however, the report points out several factors that pose challenges to the containment and mitigation measures, in particular the large and densely populated urban informal settlements, poor access to safe water and sanitation facilities, and fragile health systems. ultimately, the magnitude of the impact will depend on the public’s reaction within respective countries, the spread of the disease, and the policy response. and these factors together could lead to reduced labor market participation, capital underutilization, lower human capital accumulation, and long-term productivity effects.
“in addition to containment measures, we have seen that in responding to covid-19, countries are opting for a combination of emergency fiscal and monetary policy actions with many central banks in the region taking important actions like cutting interest rates and providing extraordinary liquidity assistance,” said albert zeufack, chief economist for africa at the world bank. “however, it is important to ensure that fiscal policy builds in space for social protection interventions, especially targeting workers in the informal sector, and sows the seed for future resilience of our economies.”
the authors emphasize the need for a customized policy response to reflect the structure of african economies (especially the large informal sector) and the peculiar constraints policymakers currently face, particularly the deteriorating fiscal positions and heightened public debt vulnerabilities, and the overall low operational capacity to respond.
“the immediate measures are important but there is no doubt there will be need for some sort of debt relief from bilateral creditors to secure the resources urgently needed to fight covid-19 and to help manage or maintain macroeconomic stability in the region,” said cesar calderon, lead economist and lead author of the report.
due to the covid-19 pandemic, economic circumstances within countries and regions are fluid and change on a day-by-day basis. the macroeconomic analysis in the report is based on data available by the first quarter of march 2020.
the world bank group is taking broad, fast action to help developing countries strengthen their pandemic response, increase disease surveillance, improve public health interventions, and help the private sector continue to operate and sustain jobs. it is deploying up to $160 billion in financial support over the next 15 months to help countries protect the poor and vulnerable, support businesses, and bolster economic recovery."
"554 people who were quarantined released after being tested negativeairline operators are banned to transport a corpse which is known to have acquired coronavirus into the country aiming to prevent the virus transmission.
in a letter the ethiopian public health institute (ephi) wrote to ethiopian civil aviation authority, the institute disclosed that the case of covid 19 and its transmission manners is new and still under study.
the letter signed by aschalew abayneh, deputy director of ephi, added that any contact with the infected body is highly contagious and the virus will be transmitted to others.
“for the sake of protecting the society from covid 19 outbreak the ethiopian civil aviation authority should inform airline operators not to transport coronavirus infected corpse to the country,” the letter states.
tamiru tadesse, ephi’s covid response team leader at ethiopian airports enterprise, told capital that usually the institute is undertaking body test for any transmitted diseases at the airport.
“at this time of the pandemic we are looking the matter separately since we have to control the virus,” he said.
he said that as per the letter the country will never receive covid 19 infected corpse.
he expressed his expectation from the authority to address the information to all the operators that fly to the country.
“so far there were not any contaminated corpse arrived and it will never,” he added.
in ethiopia most of the effected individuals are those who returned to the country from different corner of the world.
as of march 23 the government applied forced quarantine for travelers who come from abroad.
the virus has infected over 1.6 million people in the world and tens of thousands died because of the virus. several media reports stated that several ethiopia diaspora members also lost their life because of the virus.
the influence of coronavirus has affected several activities in the world, while the aviation industry particularly public transport is suspended in most of the destinations in the world and airline operators has also suspended their service fully or some of them only operates in a very limited level of their capacity.
the cargo service is ongoing meanwhile the effect of the virus limited the economic activity in the world.
in related development minister of health lia tadesse said 554 people who were quarantined for 14 days in different parts of addis ababa were released after all of them tested negative for the deadly coronavirus.
the government of ethiopia introduced forced quarantined measures against passengers arriving in addis ababa from any part of the world in a bid to stem the spread of covid-19.
the passengers were quarantined in selected hotels with their own expenses and those who could not cover their hotel accommodations were quarantined on university grounds and schools.
the minister called on the public to refrain from any discrimination against those passengers who were quarantined upon arrival for health safety purposes.
according to the minister, currently, there are 2036 people who are still in quarantine centers where their health status is followed by health professionals.
the minister said the quarantine activities which are being done upon the recommendations of the world health organization were fruitful."
"the international air transport association has released new analysis showing that some 25 million jobs are at risk of disappearing with plummeting demand for air travel amid the covid-19 crisis.
globally, the livelihoods of some 65.5 million people are dependent on the aviation industry, including sectors such as travel and tourism. among these are 2.7 million airlines jobs. in a scenario of severe travel restrictions lasting for three months, iata research calculates that 25 million jobs in aviation and related sectors are endangered across the world. these are 11.2 million jobs in asia-pacific, 5.6 million jobs in europe, 2.9 million jobs in latin america, 2 million jobs in north america, 2 million jobs in africa, and 0.9 million jobs in the middle east.
in the same scenario, airlines are expected to see full year passenger revenues fall by $252 billion (-44%) in 2020 compared to 2019. the second quarter is the most critical with demand falling 70% at its worst point, and airlines burning through $61 billion in cash.
airlines are calling on governments to provide immediate financial aid to help airlines to remain viable businesses able to lead the recovery when the pandemic is contained. specifically, iata calls for direct financial support, loans, loan guarantees and support for the corporate bond market, and tax relief.
“there are no words to adequately describe the devastating impact of covid-19 on the airline industry. and the economic pain will be shared by 25 million people who work in jobs dependent upon airlines. airlines must be viable businesses so that they can lead the recovery when the pandemic is contained. a lifeline to the airlines now is critical,” said alexandre de juniac, iata’s director general and ceo.
alongside vital financial relief, the industry will also need careful planning and coordination to ensure that airlines are ready when the pandemic is contained.
“we have never shuttered the industry on this scale before. consequently, we have no experience in starting it up. it will be complicated. at the practical level, we will need contingencies for licenses and certifications that have expired. we will have to adapt operations and processes to avoid reinfections via imported cases. and we must find a predictable and efficient approach to managing travel restrictions which need to be lifted before we can get back to work. these are just some of the major tasks that are ahead of us. and to be successful, industry and government must be aligned and working together,” said de juniac.
iata is scoping a comprehensive approach to re-booting the industry when governments and public health authorities allow. a multi-stakeholder approach will be essential. one initial step is a series of virtual meetings-or summits-on a regional basis, bringing together governments and industry stakeholders."
"almost every country in the world now has at least a few people infected with sars-cov-2. the novel coronavirus that emerged late last year in china has taken the world by storm, becoming a nightmare for many countries’ health systems, pushing the world into a crisis, and pushing nearly 3.5 billion people into self-imposed or mandatory confinement.the long-term effects of the pandemic are still unknown at this point. there are, in turn, several industries that feel the full effect of the crisis.the global entertainment industry was among the first hit hard by the pandemic. governments all over the world have limited the number of people allowed to gather – in some places, to three, in others, to two – and ordering the closure of venues where people gather and spend a relatively long time.“as a result, sporting events, movie screenings, conventions, and similar gatherings are out of the question. restaurants, bars, even the casinos were affected by the coronavirus pandemic – in some countries – all of the had to close. luckily, home delivery is still working, and those with a passion for gaming can always explore the world of progressive jackpots and tons of games online. in the areas hit hardest by the disease, some of the already empty hotels are used by the authorities as makeshift hospitals to treat the milder cases of infection, thus freeing up hospital beds for those in a more serious condition.”concerts, conventions, festivals, and movie premieres are postponed and cancelled. sports are pretty much off the table in the northern hemisphere, even the summer olympics were postponed for 2021. and things are not expected to return to normal for at least a year.the restrictions imposed by the health authorities on travel are a major blow to airlines all over the world. the global airline industry will lose hundreds of billions this year. in an estimate issued in mid-march, international air transport association economist brian pearce pointed out that up to 75% of all airlines have reserves to last them up to three months – and if their revenues don’t return to normal (or they don’t receive a massive infusion of cash from other sources, like governments), many of them can go bankrupt.airports are in a similar situation – they, too, have fixed costs and no revenues to cover them.with people on lockdown, with planes grounded due to a massive lack of demand, oil consumption has reached a new low – and so did the price of oil. to make things worse, the production cut requirements of opec+ countries have expired on april 1st, and at least some of them have announced that they plan to ramp up production starting this date.these factors have led to a massive drop in the price of crude oil to a point unseen since 2002. analysts expect the drops to continue as the global crude storage capacity reaching its limits by the second quarter of this year – some say oil prices may even test the $10 per barrel level.the demand for entire categories of products is at a minimum due to the ongoing pandemic. car manufacturers are reporting a drop in demand – france, for example, has reported a 72% year-on-year drop in new car registrations in march. transport companies are also feeling the decrease in demand, reporting two-digit decreases across the board. and decreases have been reported in every sector from movie production to construction."
"anticipating a surge in patients with covid-19, the ministry of health (moh) has called on retired medical staffs, in-training medical professionals, unemployed medical school graduates and other volunteers, to join the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
according to the moh, the health professionals, who respond to the national call, will be assigned to various roles, based on their academic background and services in different units including laboratory surveillance, point of entry screening, risk communication and community engagement, and case management isolation,
the registration of health professionals is officially underway via the official website of the ministry which went live on april 01, 2020.
before the virus overwhelms the country, the government of ethiopia has already embarked on various preventative measures to combat the virus, and has setup, in a recently inaugurated mental health facility, eka kotebe general hospital, an isolation and treatment center for covid-19 cases. other 134 quarantine and isolation centers have also recently been identified and arranged.
the hospital has installed around 172 health professionals, 22 medical doctors and 150 nurses to be in the fight against the virus.
as the number of covid-19 cases continues to rise rapidly across the globe, critical shortage of healthcare workers and personal protective equipment’s (ppe) have become a crucial part in the global fight against the virus.
even where well-established healthcare systems have found it hard to cope with the deluge of patients and healthcare workers falling ill, and for ethiopia, with one of the world’s lowest doctor to patient ratio, shortage of health professionals and ppe’s would be alarming.
in ethiopia, by saturday april 4, there are 38 covid-19 patients."
"an initial analysis by mckinsey, a us management consulting firm, predicts that the african economy will lose between $90 billion and $200 billion over the next nine months alone.
the research oversees four scenarios that show that african gdp could shrink by between 3 to 8 percent in 2020 that translates into a loss of between $90 billion and $200 billion for african economies.
although according to the projects that things are going to get worse particularly if containment measures do not prove effective, in the absence of major fiscal stimulus, this pandemic is likely to tip africa into further economic contraction in 2020.
to gauge the possible extent of this impact, mckinsey modeled four scenarios for how differing rates of covid-19 transmission – both globally and within africa – would affect africa’s economic growth.
even in the most optimistic scenario, mckinsey project that africa’s gdp growth would be cut to just 0.4 percent in 2020 – and this scenario is looking less and less likely by the day. in all other scenarios, mckinsey project that africa will experience an economic contraction in 2020, with its gdp growth rate falling by between five and eight percentage points. the first scenario is set as ‘contained global and africa outbreak.’ in this least-worst case, africa’s average gdp growth in 2020 would be cut from 3.9 percent (the forecast prior to the crisis) to 0.4 percent. this scenario assumes that asia experiences a continued recovery from the pandemic, and a gradual economic restart. in africa, mckinsey assumes that most countries experience isolated cases or small cluster outbreaks – but with carefully managed restrictions and a strong response, there is no widespread outbreak. and the worst case scenario is ‘resurgent global outbreak, africa widespread.’ in this case, africa’s average gdp growth in 2020 would be cut by about eight percentage points, resulting in a negative growth rate of -3.9 percent. globally, mckinsey assumes that europe and the united states continue to face significant outbreaks as china and east asian countries face a surge of re-infection. in addition, significant outbreaks occur in most major african economies, leading to a serious economic downturn.
the report recommended that governments, the private sector and development institutions need to double down on their already proven resolve and significantly expand existing efforts to safeguard economies and livelihoods across africa.
the report further suggests as a framework for near term action by governments, the private sector, and development institutions to mitigate this impact. these actions are drawn from a global scan of economic interventions already being implemented or considered, and recent discussions with public- and private-sector leaders across africa.
however the report suggests that in many countries, there is an opportunity to take bolder, more creative steps to secure supply chains of essential products, contain the health crisis, maintain the stability of financial systems, help businesses survive, and support households’ economic welfare.
so decision makers should intended with data and tools to inform and strengthen their response in order to make the most of the limited time and resources available.
according to the africa development bank outlook before the outbreak and spread of the pandemic the real gdp growth, estimates at 3.4 percent for 2019, is projected to accelerate to 3.9 percent in 2020 and to 4.1 percent in 2021.
however, to make africa’s growth more inclusive, countries need to deepen structural reforms to diversify their productive base, build resilience to extreme weather events by adopting climate-smart agricultural techniques and providing risk-sharing platforms for households, create more fiscal space to expand social safety nets and increase the efficiency of existing programs, and remove obstacles to the movement of workers to more productive opportunities within and across countries.
in a related development, the economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic in ethiopia – in regards to the airline industry and allied businesses – could cost the country some usd 1.2 billion in gdp and affect more than 323,000 jobs, a global airline body disclosed.
in a statement issued on thursday, the international air transport association (iata) highlighted the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on africa and middle east. iata strengthened its call for urgent action from governments in africa and the middle east to provide financial relief to airlines as the association’s latest scenario for potential revenue loss by carriers in africa and the middle east reached usd 23 billion (19 billion in the middle east and four billion in africa). this translates into a drop of industry revenues of 32 percent for africa and 39 percent for the middle east for 2020 as compared to 2019.
iata revealed that ethiopia will have 1.6 million fewer passengers resulting in a usd 0.3 billion revenue loss, risking 327,062 jobs and usd 1.2 billion in contribution to ethiopia’s economy. in 2017 the country’s passenger journey was 7.3 million."
"water bottlers association denounces unreasonable price increment of the product by retailers meanwhile there is no change at the factory.
ethiopian bottled water, soft drink, fruit and vegetable manufacturing industries association (ebsfmia) that met with media on thursday april 2 stated that members of the association do not make any price increment on their products.
the association said that it has learnt that price increment on products is observed in the past few weeks in relation with the outbreak of coronavirus at the retail market.
“we have confirmed that the price of bottled water is sold with a higher profit margin at retail markets, which is totally unacceptable,” the association said.
“it called relevant government body to control those who illegally hike the price of basic needs,” the association stated.
it recalled that based on ebsfmia code of conduct the manufacturer selling price range is set by the association and is revised every one or two months. currently the price of manufacturing product price range is reduced in relation with the recently revised excise tax, production increment and lower demand observed recently, according to the information that capital obtained from the association.
at the same time the distribution rate that is handled by separate distributing agents is also going well but the price at the final sellers has extraordinary profit margin, which is baseless, the association claimed.
the government disclosed that the price of some basic commodities have shown increment in the past couple of weeks after the announcement of the first covid 19 case in the country. bottled water is one of the products that shows unreasonable price increment.
it has also taken nationwide measures on illegal traders. on thursday april 2 the number of illegal traders penalized by the government has reached over 15,000.
ashenafi merid, general manager of ebsfmia, said bottlers are responsible to follow their agents.
“currently bottlers have ample supply and due to that any price increment is not acceptable,” he told capital.
consumer protection and trade competition and ministry of trade and industry are expected to control retailers.
getnet ashenafi, legal expert at consumer protection and trade competition, appreciated the initiative of the association to protect their consumer and said that other sectors should follow the same. he stated that measures are continuing on illegal actors.
solomon tadele director general of food, beverage and pharmaceutical industry development institute, which is under ministry of trade industry, disclosed that despite public transports suspension to regions, food items continue to reach the market.
ebsfmia has more than 120 members and most of them are water bottlers."
"care’s analysis of inform global risk index data has found that the world’s ‘highest risk’ countries have three times higher exposure to epidemics, such as covid-19, but also have a six times higher risk in terms of their access to healthcare compared to the world’s lowest risk countries. somalia, central african republic, south sudan, yemen, afghanistan, chad, syria, the democratic republic of congo, iraq, ethiopia, nigeria, sudan, niger, haiti and uganda are all considered ‘very high risk’ by inform and are amongst the countries with the weakest capacity to cope with the added stress of a pandemic such as covid-19.
“while even wealthy and better prepared nations are struggling to cope at this time, the impact on the countries highlighted in this analysis shows how people living in insecure environments, with extremely weak health infrastructure, are going to be far worse off. countries such as south sudan and syria are in the midst of conflict. many countries on this list are already food insecure, with large parts of their populations reliant on international aid for survival. add on covid-19 and it is not only national health systems that will struggle to cope, but the entire infrastructure and basic services. this is a truly terrifying thought for all of us working in the humanitarian sector,” says sally austin, care international’s head of emergency operations.
as tue jakobsen care turkey’s, assistant country director – humanitarian notes “in northwest syria, there is no functioning government and the health system has been destroyed over the past nine years. hundreds of thousands of people are not able to do basic preventative measure, such as wash their hands. with no testing capacity, it is highly likely that the virus has been spreading around without our knowledge, so we might be weeks behind in our response. an outbreak will cause mayhem in an area that has already gone through so much suffering. we are currently at a stage where only around 900 testing kits have been made available this week in idlib and there is only one lab that can that can handle about 20 tests per day. since this is a global crisis, countries are prioritizing their own responses and syria has been completely neglected. there is an urgent need to scale up the health response and increase health supplies going into northwest syria.”
on top of poor access to healthcare these countries also face the highest levels of food insecurity, displacement and socio-economic inequality. all of which increase they vulnerability to covid-19 and the likely levels of devastation the virus will have in a given country.
care’s analysis found that in comparison to the 36 ‘very low risk’ countries, including norway, uk and new zealand, the 14 most vulnerable and ‘very high risk’ countries are at over 4 times (336%) higher risk of food insecurity, almost 9 times (756%) higher risk of socioeconomic vulnerability, and over three times more likely to be providing refuge for displaced and uprooted people (210% greater risk level)
“this data shows a stark and chilling picture of what we can expect as we start to see the covid-19 pandemic spread to many asian, africa and middle eastern countries. in order to try and best prepare, at care, where possible, we are scaling up our activities to ensure that clear guidance on risk, prevention and awareness of symptoms are available in the communities where we work. we are scaling up water supply activities to facilitate good personal and household hygiene,” austin said.
“but this alone is clearly not enough. we need strong commitments from all national governments to immediately respect the global cease fire called for by the un secretary general earlier this week and we need to ensure humanitarians are seen as essential workers and supported to have unimpeded access to continue to deliver lifesaving assistance to already highly vulnerable communities. we also call on all major donors to show solidarity and contribute to the global appeal that was launched on 25th march,” says austin.
austin adds “if coronavirus has shown us one thing it is that we are all in this together. the sense of community this pandemic has created is truly heart-warming. we are asking people to go one step further and not just care for their local communities, but also to think about their global community, and those likely to be affected even worse.”"
"floriculture actors asks the government for expedite measure to keep the sector from damage due to the outbreak of coronavirus epidemic. government officials and exporters discussed the latest situation and the way-out.
mid this week in the meeting co-chaired by girma birru, advisor at the prime minister office, and omer hussein, minister of agriculture, exporters including the coffee, leather, textile, livestock and meat, and sesame expressed their concern and challenges that might occur and already happening in their business.
according to those who attended the meeting that include few individuals due to the fear of the pandemic, the private sector expressed its fears related with the virus, while most of the export challenge related with corona is mainly affecting the horticulture sector than other major export businesses.
tewodros zewdie, executive director at ethiopian horticulture producer exporters association (ehpea), who attended the meeting, told capital that the concerns have grabbed the attention of government officials. “we are looking swift measure by today or saturday,” he told capital on friday via telephone conversation.
“the concern of others looks like they keep working in the export, while we are now almost inactive on the business,” he explained.
according to the information from ehpea the export of flower has dropped by 80 percent from the normal time. most of the product is transported to the netherlands market.
friday afternoon prime minister abiy ahmed announced some macro-economic measures besides several other mitigation strategies.
he announced that the government decided national bank of ethiopia to avail birr 15 billion liquidity for private banks to enable them to provide debt relief and additional loans to their customers in need.
abiy’s measure also included the removal of the minimum price set by the national bank of ethiopia on the horticulture sector for flower exports, and the ministry of revenue to expedite vat returns to support companies with cash flows.
the association asked the government to reschedule ongoing loans and provide working capital for the farms to keep running the operation, which have over 150,000 employees.
the vat refund is also the other area that the government is expected to extradite to support the growers cash flow. besides the vat refund suspension the association wants a protection from labor laws in case of downsizing the labor force.
ease the hard currency repatriation threshold, which is usd 3.86 per kilogram of flower, is also the other area the association needs from government to be considered.
making sure that airfreight cargo services are accessible even with less frequencies and with reduced rates is also the other area that the growers needs to be soft.
after the pm disclosed some measures the association appreciated the government decision."
"the human dimensions of the covid-19 pandemic reach far beyond the critical health response. all aspects of our future will be affected – economic, social and developmental. our response must be urgent, coordinated and on a global scale, and should immediately deliver help to those most in need.
from workplaces, to enterprises, to national and global economies, getting this right is predicated on social dialogue between governments and those on the front line – the employers and workers. so that the 2020s don’t become a re-run of the 1930s.
ilo estimates are that as many as 25 million people could become unemployed, with a loss of workers’ income of as much as usd 3.4 trillion. however, it is already becoming clear that these numbers may underestimate the magnitude of the impact.
this pandemic has mercilessly exposed the deep faultlines in our labour markets. enterprises of all sizes have already stopped operations, cut working hours and laid off staff. many are teetering on the brink of collapse as shops and restaurants close, flights and hotel bookings are cancelled, and businesses shift to remote working. often the first to lose their jobs are those whose employment was already precarious – sales clerks, waiters, kitchen staff, baggage handlers and cleaners.
in a world where only one in five people are eligible for unemployment benefits, layoffs spell catastrophe for millions of families. because paid sick leave is not available to many carers and delivery workers – those we all now rely on – they are often under pressure to continue working even if they are ill. in the developing world, piece-rate workers, day labourers and informal traders may be similarly pressured by the need to put food on the table. we will all suffer because of this. it will not only increase the spread of the virus but in the longer-term dramatically amplify cycles of poverty and inequality.
we have a chance to save millions of jobs and enterprises, if governments act decisively to ensure business continuity, prevent layoffs and protect vulnerable workers. we should have no doubt that the decisions they take today will determine the health of our societies and economies for years to come.
unprecedented, expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are essential to prevent the current headlong downturn from becoming a prolonged recession. we must make sure that people have enough money in their pockets to make it to the end of the week – and the next. this means ensuring that enterprises — the source of income for millions of workers — can remain afloat during the sharp downturn and so are positioned to restart as soon as conditions allow. in particular, tailored measures will be needed for the most vulnerable workers, including the self-employed, part-time workers and those in temporary employment, who may not qualify for unemployment or health insurance and who are harder to reach.
as governments try to flatten the upward curve of infection, we need special measures to protect the millions of health and care workers (most of them women) who risk their own health for us every day. truckers and seafarers, who deliver medical equipment and other essentials, must be adequately protected. teleworking offers new opportunities for workers to keep working, and employers to continue their businesses through the crisis. however, workers must be able to negotiate these arrangements so that they retain balance with other responsibilities, such as caring for children, the sick or the elderly, and of course themselves.
many countries have already introduced unprecedented stimulus packages to protect their societies and economies and keep cash flowing to workers and businesses. to maximise the effectiveness of those measures it is essential for governments to work with employers’ organizations and trade unions to come up with practical solutions, which keep people safe and to protect jobs."
"the flagship airline ethiopian airlines has asked staff to take their annual leave in the coming weeks to help it cope with the impact of the coronavirus from low percentage of passengers.
the airline has offered a special leave scheme to most of the employees in a specific set of time starting from this week on.
even if as international airlines have canceled their flights to china amid fear over the corona virus, africa’s largest air carrier, ethiopian airlines, has refused to do so. “the airline is seeing a 20% decline in demand, the corona virus is a huge challenge” said tewolde gebremariam, ceo of ethiopian airlines group on african aviation week that was held last week in addis ababa. the outbreak of the virus demonstrates the resilience of the industry, not just passengers also cargo flights especially to china have been declining.
due to the high spread of the virus there is a worldwide fear of travel and governments are banning their citizens to move from one parts of the world to the other.
“at such times the air line take this kind of options and helps to minimize the effects, as the situation remains dynamic, our flight schedules may change at short notice to comply with regulatory directives or operational requirements. at all times, we aim to provide the updated information to our esteemed customers as early as possible,” the airlines stated.
change fees are not applicable to tickets issued anytime for travel from march 1onwards until june 30. if there is a difference in the airfare or applicable taxes, due to the reissue/rerouting of the ticket, the additional amount will need to be collected. customers can change their booking to travel on/or before december 31, 2020, the airline said in a statement.
air traffic routes between africa and asia grew by five per cent in 2019 – more than the global average. now, african carriers fear a shortfall of more than $400m (352,3m euro) due to the disruption of services to china alone, a direct result of the coronavirus outbreak.
raphaël kuuchi, vice-president for africa of the international air transport association (iata), said that “initial estimates indicate that $400m could be lost” by the continent’s airlines, based on data gathered “in the second week of february” and due solely to the cancellation of services to china.
the data were made public during the aviation africa summit, held 4–5 march in addis ababa.
the coronavirus epidemic has forced almost all african airlines – with the exception of ethiopian airlines – to stop flying to china.
airlines all over the world are hit hard by coronavirus in the past few weeks. the effects are also estimated to wipe out up to usd 113 billion in worldwide revenues this year, a trade group said, a new blow to the industry.
it has been almost 20 years since the aviation industry faced such an existential threat. after the terrorist attacks of sept. 11, 2001, global air travel plummeted, and it took years for airlines to fully recover. today there are worries that the coronavirus could have a similarly disastrous impact.
“at the end of last week, we started seeing very sharp declines,” gary kelly, chief executive of southwest airlines, said on cnbc. “it has a 9/11-like feel.”
the aviation industry was already grappling with the worldwide grounding of boeing’s 737 max, which has been out of service for a year after two deadly crashes. losing that one plane sapped some airlines of expected growth, forced them to cancel thousands of flights and resulted in billions of dollars in losses.
the more fundamental issue posed by the coronavirus – that large swaths of the traveling public may simply stay off planes for the foreseeable future – is a far greater threat. though still in its early stages, there are concerns that a prolonged disruption could do lasting economic damage. commercial aviation, like the internet, is part of the connective tissue of the global economy."
"26th out of 31 in the sub-saharan africa regionthe world justice project (wjp) released the wjp rule of law index 2020, an annual report based on national surveys of more than 130,000 households and 4,000 legal practitioners and experts around the world.
the wjp rule of law index measures rule of law performance in 128 countries and jurisdictions across eight primary factors: constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, open government, fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice, and criminal justice. the index is the world’s leading source for original, independent data on the rule of law.
ethiopia’s overall rule of law score decreased 5.6% in this year’s index. at 114th place out of 128 countries and jurisdictions worldwide, ethiopia improved six positions in global rank. ethiopia’s score places it at 26 out of 31 countries in the sub-saharan africa region and 16 out of 19 among low income countries.
significant trends for ethiopia included an improvement in the factors measuring constraints on government powers, open government, and fundamental rights, and a deterioration in the factor measuring order and security.
denmark, norway, and finland topped the wjp rule of law index rankings in 2020. venezuela, rb; cambodia; and democratic republic of the congo had the lowest overall rule of law scores—the same as in 2019.
more countries declined than improved in overall rule of law performance for a third year in a row, continuing a negative slide toward weakening and stagnating rule of law around the world. the majority of countries showing deteriorating rule of law in the 2020 index also declined in the previous year, demonstrating a persistent downward trend. this was particularly pronounced in the index factor measuring constraints on government powers.
the declines were widespread and seen in all corners of the world. in every region, a majority of countries slipped backward or remained unchanged in their overall rule of law performance since the 2019 wjp rule of law index.
regionally, sub-saharan africa’s top performer in the index is namibia (35th out of 128 countries globally), followed by rwanda and mauritius. the three countries with the lowest scores in the region were mauritania, cameroon, and democratic republic of the congo (126th out of 128 countries globally).
countries with the strongest improvement in rule of law were ethiopia (5.6% increase in score, driven primarily by gains in constraints on government powers and fundamental rights) and malaysia (5.1%, driven primarily by gains in constraints on government powers, fundamental rights, and regulatory enforcement).
the largest declines in the rule of law were seen in cameroon (-4.4%, driven primarily by falling scores in order and security and fundamental rights) and iran (-4.2%, driven primarily by falling scores in criminal justice). over the last five years, countries experiencing the largest average annual percentage drop in the rule of law were egypt (-4.6 %); venezuela, rb (-3.9%); cambodia (-3.0%); philippines (-2.5%); cameroon (-2.4%); hungary (-2.1%); and bosnia and herzegovina (-2.1%).
the single biggest decline by factor over the past five years was egypt’s and poland’s score for constraints on government powers, with an average annual decline of -8.5% and -6.8%, respectively.
“the rule of law is not just a matter for judges or lawyers,” said william h. neukom, wjp founder and ceo. “it is the bedrock of communities of justice, opportunity, and peace. we are all stakeholders in the rule of law and therefore we all have a role to play in upholding it. the 2020 index underscores that we have our work cut out for us.”"
"in its second interim report published on march 9, 2020, a year after the disaster, ethiopian investigators reinstated that it was the faulty mcas design that caused the crash of flight et302. they also qualified the training provided by boeing as “inadequate”.
as it has already been determined in the initial report published in april 2019, a malfunction of the mcas system was the main reason behind the crash. according to the investigators, that malfunction can be blamed on a faulty design: the reliance on the readings of a single angle of attack probe without redundancy “made it vulnerable to unwanted activation.”
“shortly after liftoff, the left angle of attack sensor recorded value became erroneous,” recounts the report. the incorrect measurement triggered the mcas system which automatically tried to push down the nose several times. the captain tried to fight back the system, requesting his first officer to help him (“pull with me”), to no avail.
according to the report, the pilots of flight et302 followed the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. thus, the investigators say that their training was at fault. “the difference training from b737ng to b737 max provided by the manufacturer was found to be inadequate,” they said. “there was a deviation between the left and right recorded angle of attack /aoa/ values,” says the report.
the usa house transport committee report also accuses the federal aviation administration for the approval of the planes and boeing design failures.
on october 29, 2018, indonesian carrier lion air operating flight 610 from soekarno–hatta international airport in jakarta to depati amir airport in pangkal pinang, crashed into the java sea 13 minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 passengers and crew. the conclusion echoes the final report of the lion air jt610 crash published on october 24, 2019, in which the indonesian investigators also recommended for boeing to review its documentation regarding the max.
less than five months later, on march 10, 2019, in strikingly similar circumstances, ethiopian airlines flight 302 another 737 max aircraft crashed six minutes after takeoff on a flight from addis ababa, to nairobi, kenya. the two brand new aircraft, derivative model, to crash within five months of each other and killed 346 peoples.
the committee’s preliminary findings identify five central themes that affected the design, development, and certification of the 737 max and faa’s oversight of boeing which are production pressures, faulty assumptions, culture of concealment that boeing withheld crucial information from the faa, its customers, and 737 max pilots, conflicted representation faa’s current oversight structure with respect to boeing creates inherent conflicts of interest, boeing’s influence over the faa’s oversight
manuel von ribbeck of ribbeck law chartered, who represents around 80 families of both crashes and took the case to chicago court, stated that “he is very pleased with the amount of attention and work the committee has done on behalf of the families and the public in general.”
the report recommended the issues must be addressed by both boeing and the faa in order to correct poor certification practices that have emerged, faulty analytical assumptions that have surfaced, notably insufficient transparency by boeing, and inadequate oversight of boeing by the faa.
the final report of the ethiopian aircraft accident investigation bureau is reportedly “under progress”.
the faa grounded the 737 max three days after the ethiopian airlines crash, following similar actions taken by china, the european union, and canada, among others and still grounded."
"unctad published a technical note entitled global trade impact of the coronavirus (covid-19) epidemic to evaluate the economic impacts.
over the last two decades china become the world’s largest exporter and an integral part of global production networks. china has established itself as a key provider of inputs and components for many products, such as automobiles, cellphones, medical equipment, and more.
over the last month, china has seen a dramatic reduction in its manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (pmi) to 37.5, its lowest reading since 2004. this drop implies a 2% reduction in output on an annual basis. this has come as a direct consequence of the spread of corona virus (covid-19).
the 2% contraction in china’s output has ripple effects through the global economy and thus far has caused an estimated drop of about us$50 billion across countries. the most affected sectors include precision instruments, machinery, automotive and communication equipment.
among the most affected economies are the european union, usa, japan, republic of korea and vietnam.
even if the outbreak of covid-19 is contained mostly within china, the fact that chinese suppliers are critical for many companies around the world implies that any disruption in china will be also felt outside the country’s borders, impacting european, american and east asian regional value chains.
the estimated global effects are subject to change depending on the containment of the virus and or changes in the sources of supply.covid-19 hits january passenger demand
the international air transport association (iata) announced global passenger traffic data for january 2020 showing that demand (measured in total revenue passenger kilometers or rpks) climbed 2.4% compared to january 2019. this was down from 4.6% year-over-year growth for the prior month and is the lowest monthly increase since april 2010, at the time of the volcanic ash cloud crisis in europe that led to massive airspace closures and flight cancellations. january capacity (available seat kilometers or asks) increased by 1.7%. load factor climbed 0.6 percentage point to 80.3%.
“january was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the covid-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in china did not begin until 23 january. nevertheless, it was still enough to cause our slowest traffic growth in nearly a decade,” said alexandre de juniac, iata’s director general and ceo.
january international passenger demand rose 2.5% compared to january 2019, down from 3.7% growth the previous month. with the exception of latin america, all regions recorded increases, led by airlines in africa and the middle east that saw minimal impact from the covid-19 outbreak in january. capacity climbed 0.9%, and load factor rose 1.2 percentage points to 81.1%.
african airlines’ traffic climbed 5.3% in january, up slightly from 5.1% growth in december. capacity rose 5.7%, however, and load factor slipped 0.3 percentage point to 70.5%.
asia-pacific airlines’ january traffic climbed 2.5% compared to the year-ago period, which was the slowest outcome since early 2013 and a decline from the 3.9% increase in december. softer gdp growth in several of the region’s key economies was compounded by covid-19 impacts on the international china market. capacity rose 3.0% and load factor slid 0.4 percentage point to 81.6%.“no touching” – rwanda pm issues new directives on corona virus
prime minister edouard ngirente of rwanda has issued directives aimed at averting a possible spread of the deadly new coronavirus as the epidemic spreads to different african countries.
rwanda has not registered a case of new coronavirus but as the virus continues to be detected in different african countries, rwanda is on high alert to ensure that the virus which has so far been detected in south africa, nigeria, senegal, egypt, morocco and tunisia does not reach rwanda.
rwanda has tightened measures to prevent coronavirus, including setting up cameras at kigali international airport and all entry points as well as placing hand washing equipment and sanitizers in public places.
the prime minister’s directives are based on the findings of a taskforce set up to tighten the preparedness of the country to deal with a possible outbreak.
“in order to prevent and mitigate the risk of coronavirus (covid-19) transmission; the government of rwanda has set up a multidisciplinary team to assess and strengthen preparedness and response to the epidemic,” an announcement from the pm’s office reads.
togo confirms 1st coronavirus case
country’s first covid-19 patient is 42-year-old woman who recently travelled to france, germany, and turkey
the government of togo confirmed the country’s first coronavirus case on friday.
in a statement, the togolese government said the patient who tested positive for the novel coronavirus known as covid-19 was a woman, and recently travelled to benin, france, germany, and turkey.
she returned to togo from benin by road and arrived in the capital lome on march 2.
the statement said the 42-year-old patient was currently isolated at an infectious disease treatment center and there were no major concerns regarding her health.
togo joins a growing list of african countries with coronavirus cases, which include cameroon, senegal, south africa, nigeria, and algeria.
the new coronavirus emerged in wuhan, china, last december and has now spread to more than 80 countries.
the global death toll is nearing 3,500, with around 100,000 confirmed cases, according to the world health organization (who).
the who, which had declared the outbreak an international health emergency, recently updated the global risk level to “very high”.
south african first coronavirus case came via dubai to durban
south africa’s first coronavirus case came from italy via dubai to the main airport in the eastern city of durban, the health minister said on friday.
zweli mkhize was briefing media in hilton, the eastern south african town where the man with the virus is admitted to hospital after testing positive the day before. mkhize was correcting earlier reports that the man had come through the main international airport in johannesburg.
he added that there was currently no other south african coronavirus patient apart from the one reported already. the patient was a 38-year-old male who traveled to italy with his wife, part of a group of 10 people and returned on march 1.
president cyril ramaphosa on thursday warned that the virus would hurt travel and tourism, and have a negative impact on south africa’s already struggling economy, but urged citizens not to panic.
since the coronavirus outbreak began in the central chinese city of wuhan in december, it has infected almost 100,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,000, mostly in china."
"the development bank of ethiopia started inspecting individuals and its employees related with non-performing loan /npl/ of the bank.
highly corrupted government officials and employees of the bank contributed for the nonperforming loan of the bank to reach 16 billion birr according to haileyesus bekele president of the bank.
the president further said that one of the main reasons for the increasing of the npl is because of the less assessment on debtors, weak pre condition to get loan, giving false information to get loan by sabotaging with the employees of the bank.
hence, the bank has taken measures on five employees, according to teshome almayehu, vice president lease financing of the bank. currently five employees are behind bars and the bank is investigating 71 projects which are not paying back there debt.
the bank’s npl stood at 34 percent in the first half of the current fiscal year. in last fiscal year 2017/18, nonperforming loan ratio was at 40 percent.
shortage of foreign currency, termination of agricultural loan and political unrest around the country were point out as reasons of the rising ratio of npl in the last fiscal years.
rain fed agriculture investment and failure of rain fed commercial farms in some regions of the country is also one big player for the rapidly growing non-performing loan. as one of these reasons the bank has banned to give loan for rain fed agriculture starting from 2017.
“some of the companies have thousands of workers and has been generating foreign exchange to the country,” argues haileyesus, but currently most of the companies failed to operate competitively even as proper as they should be; they are facing marketing problems.
to resolve these in the current fiscal year the state owned bank established one branch and ratify 10 million birr annual budget to administer and manage some companies failed to attract buyers including the turkish company, ayka addis.
according to teshome, most of the companies failed to attract buyers because of their high price.
the state owned development financial institution is supervised by the public financial enterprises agency and supports developmental projects on mainly agricultural, industrial, manufacturing and foster the investment of private capital for productive purpose. one of the mandates of the bank is the provision of development credit to viable priority projects along with technical support through mobilizing resources from domestic and foreign sources.
priority area projects financed by the bank include commercial agriculture, agro-processing, manufacturing and extractive industries. dbe also extends a special line of credit for borrowers that operate in the textile, garment and leather and leather product industries. as an additional special line, the bank offers credit for the procurement of raw materials in the pharmaceutical industry and to companies that supply products to corporate government entities."
"the 1st ethio-horticulture international conference that was organized by ministry of agriculture (moa) and ethiopian horticulture producers exporters association (ehpea) and expected to gather several people from abroad and local was canceled a day before the event was supposed to be opened.
the event was scheduled to be held at ethiopian skylight hotel for two days starting from friday february 28, while the cancelation came on thursday february 27.
on tuesday february 5 aynalem nigussie, state minister of moa, gave a press briefing for media about the event and the expected out come from the international conference.
the event that is organized under public private partnership (ppp) model by moa and the private sector wing ehpea, was designed to go through challenges on the sector, evaluate the tax and insurance issues besides presentation of research papers.
at the press conference aynalem said that at the event high government officials, guests from different countries, producers and exporters, financial institutions, researchers from higher education institutions, and potential investors will attend.
she said that it has also targeted to boost the sector by amplifying its past success in the job creation and economic support. “the country agro ecology will also be promoted on the international conference,” the state minister said.
she added that challenges and success stories on the sector will be assessed followed by giving a direction by the government to solve problems and boost the sector.
sector experts claimed that such a decision would give a bad image for the country since several foreign participants were already on their way and others were preparing to come.
without further explanation moa posted on its facebook page on thursday february 27 that the conference is postponed for another time. the post does not give any given time when the conference will be held.
sources indicated that the reason for canceling the event is that higher officials are in another meeting and that they would not be able to attend the conference.
in the horticulture sector particularly in the flower subsector ethiopia has become the second biggest exporter in africa after kenya.
the sector passed bad period in the past three years in relation with the political instability in the country. but in the current budget year the sector has shown dramatic improvement regarding production and export earnings.
the first six months export report of the budget year indicated that the flower sector has been flourished, while the fruit and vegetable sector performance was high compared with the projection.
in the first half of the budget year the export of flower achieved 183 percent of the target.
in the period the sector was expected to get usd 123 million but the actual performance was usd 225.3 that is also 113 percent compared with the same period of last year.
the other sector that is included in the horticulture investment sector, fruit and vegetable, achieved a 122 percent of the target. the fruit and vegetable sector contributed usd 51 million, while the target was usd 41 million."
"hundreds of ethiopians staged a protest rally on thursday february 27, in front of the united states state department in washington d.c.
they opposed president donald trump’s government pressure on ethiopia in the negotiation on the operation and filling of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam (gerd).
“stop pressuring ethiopia,” ethiopians chanted in front of the u.s. state department.
“mr. secretary, 100+ million people deserve a fair share of the nile,” reads another placard that ethiopians carried during the demonstration.
these ethiopians say the trump administration is putting unfair pressure on ethiopia to make egypt get away with ethiopia’s right to generate electric power from the mega-dam project on the nile river.
protesters also demanded the ethiopian government to make public all details regarding problems in the negotiation.
those advocating for that position argue that the trump administration is primarily interested in helping egyptian leader sisi to get unfair deals at the expense of ethiopia.
ethiopia, egypt, and sudan have been negotiating the dam since november 2019. the united states and the world bank were present in the negotiation since then as “observers.”
reports from media outlets who claim to have insider information about the negotiation process indicated that the “observers” are putting unfair pressure on ethiopia to defend to promote egypt’s position, which is informed by the colonial-era agreement to which ethiopia was not a signatory.
in related development, ethiopia has asked the united states to postpone what was expected to be the final round of talks on the hydropower dam, it said on wednesday, delaying the potential resolution of a dispute that sparked a years-long diplomatic crisis.
“we have asked that we need more time for consultation,” bizuneh tolcha, spokesman for ethiopia’s ministry of water, irrigation and energy said, without providing details.
the final round of talks were scheduled for thursday and friday in washington. the u.s. has hosted several rounds of talks in washington with ministers from the three regional powers and the world bank after years of trilateral negotiations failed.
egypt, ethiopia and sudan said on jan.31 they would sign an agreement by the end of this month to end their differences over the filling and operation of the $4 billion grand ethiopian renaissance dam (gerd).
ethiopia is building the dam near its border with sudan on the blue nile, which flows into the nile river – the main water source for egypt’s 100 million strong population. the dam is the centrepiece in ethiopia’s bid to become africa’s biggest power exporter.
there was no immediate comment from egypt and sudan."
"according to the ethiopian productivity report labor productivity in ethiopia grew at an annual rate of 4.94% during the year from 2000 to 2016, starting from a very low point. ethiopia’s productivity level is far below from those of such latecomer competitors such as vietnam, tanzania, cambodia and myanmar.
among main sectors, services grew fastest in labor productivity, followed by manufacturing. agricultural productivity lags in both level and rising speed.
“the ethiopia productivity report offers necessary data for policy makers to go deep into the causes of this problem and find possible solutions,” said prof. kenichi ohno, professor at the national graduate institute for policy studies /grips/ and one of the participant on conducting the report.
a strong emergence of manufacturing to lead the nation’s growth into middle income has not been attained. the gdp shares and export contributions of policy supported sub-sectors such as leather; garment and food processing remain small and stagnant.
it is natural for highly industrialized economies to shift to high-tech services, but low income economies such as ethiopia need to reinforce manufacturing first. shrinkage of manufacturing before an economy attains full industrialization is in many countries as one symptom of middle income traps according to the report.
according to the data, in the future ethiopia may face the risk of “premature de-industrialization.” since around 2012, labor productivity has been driven mostly by heavy capital investment, which seemingly raises workers’ productivity even though they do not improve skills, because they have more machinery and equipment to work with. the contribution of total factor productivity /tfp/, a statistical indicator to gauge true efficiency, declined substantially. this is worrisome because investment-driven growth causes fiscal imbalance, excessive borrowing and foreign exchange shortage. acceleration is required for further progress.
labor mobility from rural to urban areas, and from agriculture to manufacturing, is quite limited in ethiopia compared with other industrializing countries with massive internal labor migration.
the report also suggests for ethiopia to set its first minimum wage. using the carefully cleaned manufacturing database of the central statistical agency from 1996 to 2016, the authors report manufacturing labor productivity growth of 4.6% per year but manufacturing labor cost per employee grew at 10.3% per year. for sound development, labor productivity and wage must rise in tandem. the nation should first attain high labor productivity, and then the fruits of this effort should be distributed fairly to workers as equally rapidly rising wages.
the ethiopia productivity report contains statistical analyses, a firm survey and policy advice. it was prepared jointly by the policy studies institute /psi/, a policy think tank of the ethiopian government, and the national graduate institute for policy studies /grips/, a national university in tokyo, japan.
the research, which started in 2018, was co-funded by the japan international cooperation agency /jica/ and psi. in the last one-and-half decades, ethiopia made great progress in real growth, fdi attraction and the construction of hard infrastructure and industrial parks. despite these achievements, structural transformation has not occurred.
the national graduate institute for policy studies, or grips, is an elite and highly selective research graduate school located in minato, tokyo. funded by the japanese government, it has the status of national university."

ethiopia’s corruption levels have seen an unremarkable change in the last year, according to the 2019 corruption perceptions index (cpi) by global anti-corruption organization, transparency international. the widespread theme of the report was one of stagnation; more than two thirds of countries listed -many of which are among the worlds most advanced economies – have remained stagnant or have experienced backsliding.
the basis of this year’s research is the relationship between politics, money and corruption, the report revealed.
the index ranks 180 countries and territories on a scale from 0-100, with countries scoring closer to 0 labeled as “highly corrupt” and countries closer to 100 as “very clean”. the lower the score, the more corruption the country experiences.
ethiopia scored 37/100 in 2019, ranking 96th out of 180 countries and territories. the recent score is an insignificant increase from the 2018 score of 34/100, ranking 114th out of 180. countries are ranked by their perceived levels of public sector corruption.
data following ethiopia’s corruption levels have shown that continuous violation of human rights have resulted in the country’s continued low score and have caused “widespread unrest” since 2015. a 2018 report by transparency international stated that corruption in ethiopia “ranges from petty to grand and acts as an impediment to its development and further exacerbating poverty.”
ethiopia’s score is seemingly a reflection of its continents status with the report showing a majority of countries in africa scoring below 50. the lowest scoring region was discovered to be sub saharan africa with an average regional score of 32/100 which was a stark contrast to the highest scoring region, western europe and the european union, with an average score of 66/100.
according to the results, corruption is more prevalent in countries where large sums of money seamlessly flows into electoral campaigns and where the country’s wealthiest have influence over the governments decision-making.
since 2012, only 22 countries have significantly improved their cpi scores, in the same breath, 21 countries have seen a significant decline in their scores since 2012.
the 34 page report concluded with recommended solutions by transparency international for countries and territories suffering from low scores. among the recommendations are strengthening electoral transparency and integrity, empowering citizens to exercise their voices, monitoring political financing of campaigns and reducing unnecessary influence in policy-making.
transparency international is a nongovernmental organization, based in berlin germany, which seeks to combat global corruption. the first corruption perceptions index launched in 1995, two years after the organization was founded. transparency international is now present in more than 100 countries, working “relentlessly to stir the world’s collective conscience and bring about change.”"
"a severe outbreak of desert locusts is wreaking havoc in ethiopia, posing a threat to rural food security. the epidemic has travelled throughout east africa, destroying crops and pastures in ethiopia, somalia, parts of sudan, eritrea and northern kenya. according to the un’s food and agricultural organization (fao) this outbreak is the “worst situation in 25 years”.
a report by the intergovernmental authority on development (igad) stated that eastern ethiopia has been severely affected by this outbreak. the highest concentration of locust in ethiopia is found in the country’s southeast region, with the likelihood of travelling southwest towards the kenyan border and the great rift valley. these conditions are predicted to persist until june due to the “favorable ecological conditions for locust breeding”. affected countries are being urged to take immediate action and control the infestation.
“prevention and control measures must be scaled up to contain further spread of the desert locust. countries must act urgently to avoid a food security crisis in the region” said workneh gebeyehu, igad’s executive secretary.
according to the report, in a day, an average swarm can destroy enough food crops to feed 2,500 people. journeying with the wind, swarms can cover 100 to 150 kilometers in one day; a single swarm can consist of 150 million locusts per square kilometer.
“‘the locust is making the bad food security situation worse in the sub-region, exacerbating the existing dire food insecurity and malnutrition in the sub-region,” said david phiri, fao sub regional coordinator for the eastern and representative of the african union and the united nations economic commission for africa.
the affected areas continue to grow with igad reporting that the swarm is likely to appear in northeast uganda and southeast sudan. of the nearly dozen existing locust species, the desert locus is the most dangerous. according to igad’s report, they span 16 million square meters across twenty countries between west africa and india.
the impact of these pests goes beyond agricultural devastations, on the 9th of january 2020, an ethiopian airlines b737-700 flight from djibouti to dire dawa was forced to land in addis ababa after the plane’s engines, windshield and nose were bombarded by a swarm of locusts.
the recommendations made by igad to curtail this plague include increased ground surveillance for early detection, increased use of wind forecasts, aggressive targeted aerial and ground spraying, immediate mapping of current invasion and forest trajectory and the use of local radio to educate citizens on early detection and encourage them to report any incidences. as this eruption is a serious threat to crops, immediate survey and control operations must be taken, the report stated."
"ethio-telecom reportedly lost an estimated 100 million ethiopian birr worth of losses in the last six months.
the state owned company disclosed about it as it is undertaking community engagement in the capital addis ababa to discuss about infrastructure security.
frehiwot tamiru, ceo of the company expressed her concern about the ever-growing damage that occurred on telecom infrastructure by well-organized criminals to the extent of killing guards. so far eight company guards were killed by the criminals.
the company held the discussion to create awareness and reveal the magnitude of the damage for practitioners and safeguard the infrastructures that tempted the organization to deliver quality service and expand its reach.
according to the ceo, telecommunication infrastructures faced 547 damages of which 90 percent were caused by intentional act where close to about 56 percent were destroyed deliberately for personal gain in the last six consecutive months.
luck of integration within utility providers’ takes 14 percent, traffic accidents 18 percent and natural disaster take 12 percent in the damage of telecom infrastructure.
according to the chief executive, the number of infrastructure damage increased by 34 percent compared to the same period last year which triggers complaints from customers.
the act of vandalism takes place in daylight supported using the vehicles, id and uniform of the company.
the cutting of fiber and copper cable network infrastructure caused repeated service interruption and incurring high maintenance cost to the country though infrastructures set to serve 20-30 years.
the company has 22,000km fiber cable throughout the country and got it difficult to safe guard the infrastructure though it deploys over 18,000 guards that work day and night. for this end close to 115 people were arrested and sentenced to up to nine years.
“the100 million birr theft and vandalism is equivalent amount of money needed to open additional 25 mobile service stations” she said and urges the stakeholders to collaborate with the company.
the 126 years old state monopoly, ethio-telecom, has over 45million clients with 85.5 coverage all over the country.
finally, she urged the general public to protect telecom infrastructure from damage adding that the company will engaged with the communities and stakeholders in creating awareness and join hands to protect."
"with the aim of boosting the production and export earnings, the country has decided to lift the tax on semi-processed leather exports, the ministry of trade and industry announced.
the government made the decision because the tax imposed on export of semi-finished leather goods some years ago has seriously affected the tanneries and exporters, according to teka gebreyesus, state minister of trade and industry who briefed reporters on wednesday. he stated that as the tax imposed on the sector was huge and identified as the main factor for the country’s failure to increase the foreign currency earnings from the leather industry, the government has decided to lift the tax on export of pickles, white-blue and crest leather products.
as of this week all exporters of semi-finished leather are exempted from tax, according to teka, who mentioned the starting of execution of the new proclamation 61/2012. it is stated that about 80 percent of skins and hides traders in ethiopia has left the industry because they are discouraged by the tax. as a result, out of the total of 17 tanneries in ethiopia five were closed and the remaining have been producing below their capacity. the tax has also discouraged foreign investors from investing in the untapped leather processing and export of ethiopia.
it is also indicated that though ethiopia has a huge potential for leather and leather goods products as the country is the leading in the number of cattle, no foreign direct investment was registered over the last seven years. with the aim of utilizing the potential of the sector, now the government is working to establish leather city park in modjo town in oromia region.
a practitioner in the sector blames the little attention given by the government from power supply to financial provision and limited supply of hard currency.
“the finance provided by the government doesn’t show the real commitment of the government as the industry needs attention with regards to access to finance in order to encourage the industry” said yared alemayehu, manager of waliya tannery.
the recent move of the ministry of finance in waving the 150 percent tax on semi-finished leather, which had disabled the industry, is taken as the major outcome in the industry."
"global freedom has continued its decline since 2008 according to the fifth annual human freedom index (hfi), the most comprehensive measure of freedom ever created for a large number of countries around the globe.
the report-copublished by the cato institute, the fraser institute in canada, and the liberales institut at the friedrich naumann foundation for freedom in germany-measures a broad array of personal, civil and economic freedoms around the world and the extent to which basic rights are protected or violated.
new zealand and switzerland are the two freest countries on this year’s index, while venezuela and syria rank last. ethiopia ranked 153 out of the total of 162 countries. the ranking is based on 76 distinct indicators of personal, civil, and economic freedom, using data from 2008 to 2017, the most recent year for which sufficient data are available.
the hfi captures the degree to which people are free to enjoy important rights such as freedom of speech, religion, association, and assembly, and also measures freedom of movement, women’s freedoms, crime and violence, and legal discrimination against same-sex relationships.
the authors–ian vasquez, director of the cato institute’s center for global liberty and prosperity, and tanja porčnik, a cato institute adjunct scholar and fraser institute senior fellow–also measure the rule of law, which they consider “an essential condition of freedom that protects the individual from coercion by others.”
the freest country in africa is mauritius (ranked 50th globally), followed by cape verde (52), botswana (60), seychelles (62), and south africa (64).
the least free country in africa is sudan (159), preceded by ethiopia (153), democratic republic of the congo (152), angola (151), and central african republic (150).
some 61 countries increased their overall freedom ratings from 2008 to 2017, while 79 countries decreased their freedom ratings. around 16 percent of the world’s population lives in the top quartile of nations in the index, while 35 percent lives in the bottom quartile of countries that have the lowest levels of freedom.
the authors also find that of the 12 major categories that make up the index, all but five have seen some deterioration. religion, identity and relationships, and rule of law saw the largest decreases since 2008, while sound money saw the largest improvement.
countries that have high personal freedom tend to exhibit high economic freedom. the freest countries in the world by quartile enjoy much greater income per person ($40,171) compared to those in the least-free quartile ($15,721). in addition, the authors find a strong correlation between human freedom and democracy.
“the evidence shows the importance of freedom in all its dimensions and how economic and personal freedom go hand in hand,” noted vasquez.
“with the rise of populism, nationalism, and hybrid forms of authoritarianism, people’s rights and freedoms are under assault in many corners of the globe. because of their inherent value and their contribution to well-being, those freedoms deserve the strongest defense,” said porčnik."
"ethiopia ranks 97th out of 117 qualifying countries in the 2019 global hunger index (ghi) with a score of 28.9 meaning there are many people in the country that are starving and climate change is making things worse.
eight european states came together to create the report using four categories: undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality.
they look at caloric deficiencies and poor nutrition. the undernourishment indicator captures the nutrition situation of the population as a whole, while the indicators specific to children reflect the nutrition status within a particularly vulnerable subset of the population for whom a lack of dietary energy, protein, and/or micronutrients (essential vitamins and minerals) leads to a high risk of illness, poor physical and cognitive development, and death.
“the rank shows that we have a long way to go to meet our sustainable development goals particularly goal 2, which is zero hunger.” said kaba urgessa, state minister of agriculture. he added that the country has the fastest growing economy in the region, it remains one of the poorest with 23 percent of the population living below the poverty line.
though measuring hunger is complicated, the global hunger index (ghi) has been designated and used as a tool to compressively measure hunger at the global, regional and national level.
“we need to work together will all stakeholders to eradicate hunger,” the state minister said.
according to the minister, the entire dependency on the ratified agriculture, subsistence agriculture, low genetic potential of indigenous animals and poor animal husbandry practices ,limited access of water and animal feed the wide spread of diseases and parasites, are among the factors contributing to the problem of under nutrition. ethiopia needs to improve irrigation practices as climate change is expected to impact 70pct of the population.
poor feeding practices for infants and children is a major factor behind these troubling numbers.
ghi scores are calculated each year to assess progress and setbacks in combating hunger and to raise awareness and understanding of the struggle against hunger, based on the report,822 million people are suffering from hunger around the world; this number has been rising for three years, and it represents a bitter setback. in four countries yemen, lebanon, central african republic, and venezuela the ghi scores are now higher than in 2000."
"investors are asking the city administration of addis ababa to restart leasing land faster. since takele uma became mayor, land leasing has been suspended. according to sources about 3,000 individuals are registered asking for land to develop but most have not received a reply.
a notice the city land development and management bureau issued on october 14 indicated that they won’t take any more requests for land.
“we are not looking to get land through special treatment,” an investor said. they insist the city administration recommence the regular land lease.
experts in the sector expressed their fear that stopping the land lease will open the sector to corruption. it is unclear why the city administration does not want to start the land lease but at the same time it facilitates plots for some few individuals through other deals.
“this is the implication of misuse of the public property,” the investors claimed.
sources said that currently the city administration is busy returning lands to previous landlords or farmers’ children that were displaced from their plots.
one observer said that those who are receiving the lands are not really the owners or the families who own the plots. after they received the land they are engaged in transferring the plot as soon as possible.
at the same time some of the lands are provided to selected individuals for investment throughout the city including in the heart of addis ababa.
capital has been trying to get clear information for two weeks from tesfaye lemma, head of the city lease office under the city land management and development bureau, about when the city will recommence the lease but he refused to give information."
"unrest in ethiopian public universities has led to increased enrollment in private higher institutions which in turn has led to corruption. brokers are asking parents for up to 50,000 birr for registration via dealers capital learned.
because there have been ongoing ethnic based clashes in public universities all over the country students have left their campuses, opting instead for private schools in addis ababa causing their numbers to mushroom.
at the end of august, the ministry of science and higher education announced that it would sign binding agreements with stakeholders in the education sector to prevent the violence, although little change has occurred.
last month, alone two students at woldia university in the amhara region and one student at dembi dollo university in the oromia region were killed.
officials from the ministry of science and higher education think that the problem behavior is being conducted by people from outside the campus using fake student ids.
as almost all private higher educational institutions have closed registration, parents are looking for ways to register their children through corrupt back channels.
the higher education, relevance and quality assurance agency (herqa), says they take special cases into account. they don’t have a mandate to decide the registration timetable. it is determined via a monthly report.
some of the private educational institutions that capital approached said, they already closed registration for many programs but there are still some students getting in through illegal means.
there are close to 236 private higher education institutions in the country. most are in addis.
alemayehu kebede advisor at ministry of science and higher education, says ethiopian universities have been facing recurrent ethnic-based conflicts, students have lost their lives and property has been damaged. he adds that one of the sources of conflict is where students and lecturers are places so they are trying to revise this practice.
there are more than 50 public universities in ethiopia and the country allots a budget of 23 billion birr for higher education."

cost was established 10 years ago with the support of the world bank group and dfid. also in 2009 there was a proclamation under the procurement and property administration, requiring public disclosure of construction costs for government projects.the report cited several major problems. some projects had no completion date.
the federal sport commission which involved in the addis ababa national stadium was unable to produce a tender document, or explain their criteria for selecting consultants. this makes it difficult evaluate the over two billion birr project.
the jinka and hawassa air fields had better ratings as the ethiopian airline group has a dedicated department strictly supervising the projects. however, it was not finished on time because of additional work. their disclosure rate was 78,9 percent which is better than other clients.
still there was questionable activity.
“the strong and dedicated infrastructure team at the ethiopian airline group that had supervised both consultants and contractors, made an usual price deduction in the cost,” yargal pointed out.
government handling of construction projects in ethiopia has been criticized for corruption.
absence of documentation and records showing the sequential process of construction proceedings failed to be completed and many projects cost more than budgeted and took longer than expected.
“they don’t have recorded files that could explain why they failed to carry out the projects on time or within the allocated budget. no government institution manages to provide completed information about the tender process, contractual agreements, the procurement process and service contact fee setups,” yaregal said.
the construction project for the ministry of foreign affairs conference room and facilities, for instance, cost 57 million birr more than expected when it was completed – increasing the cost from 147.8million birr to 205 million birr as the project had problems in design review, contract administration, and contract supervision, the study reported.
“a document or information about government projects should be recorded and kept for at least ten years, but what we have encountered is the opposite,” the board chair said.
“ethiopia is billions in debt; we should not tolerate these types of problems and the government should commit to tackling transparency in public infrastructure projects from conception through implementation,” eyasu stressed."
"awash bank welcomes the central bank’s decision to cease the nbe bill and announced the slashing of interest rates worth half a billion birr in bank revenue.
a week ago the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) with its latest directive mfa/nbebills/004/2019, has repealed mfa/nbebills/003/2018 directive forced banks to buy 27 percent of bonds on every fresh loan and advance.
it was a debated issue between the government and the private sector including the business community and international partners based on the claim the private sector would be affected with access to finance and banks would retreat to provide loans due to the directive.
they also stated that the nbe bill hiked the cost of funds boosted the loan interest rate which contributed to inflation.
banks have long complained the nbe bills shrink their liquidity and smash their capacity to provide loans for clients. they have also argued the 3 percent interest rate, which was attributed when the directive was issued and later increased to 5 percent in october 2017, was far below what banks pay as interest for the deposit. when the directive, ‘mfa/nbebills/001/2011’, became effective, the minimum interest rate was 5 percent and then increased to 7 percent a year ago when the birr was devalued by 15 percent.
during its latest press conference awash bank stated that due to lifting of the nbe bill it was encouraged to reduce interest rates in all sectors from 0.5 to 4.5 percent.
desalegn tolera, credit analysis and portfolio management deputy chief at awash bank, said the bank was undertaking a study on loan provisions and how to accelerate the business which had observed a slowdown. “in the meantime, the decision of nbe to lift the 27 percent bond purchase bill encourages us to improve our loan interest rate in favor of borrowers,” desalegn said at the press conference held on thursday november 28 at the headquarters.
since nbe introduced the nbe bill awash bought 17.1-billion-birr worth of bonds and currently the amount nbe holds is 12.1 billion birr, while the balance was paid on their maturity started in 2016.
awash is the second biggest nbe bill bond buyer after dashen bank, both of them are competing for the highest profit, currently awash appears to be slightly leading.
desalegn said due to the lifting of nbe bill the cost of funds has declined. high interest reduction mainly applies to agricultural processing and manufacturing.
according to desalegn, the service industry like hotels and tourism which contributes a lot of foreign currency will receive preferential treatment in the current loan interest rate reduction. the other priorities are health, education and agricultural.
“based on our study the bank shall lose 500-million-birr worth of revenue from loan interest by reducing the interest rate,” desalegn said.
tomas fikadu, commercial credit appraisal department head, said awash bank’s interest rate was ranging from 8.5 percent to 17.75 percent and now the maximum range has declined to 15.75 percent.
“the current reduction depends on the sector for instance one received a reduction of 4.5 percent but another three percent,” he added.
according to bank officials, the interest decrease means inflation will go down because it helps borrowers access credit at a lower cost.
since the introduction of the nbe bill banks have increased their interest rate to accommodate their cost of funds. experts argued the interest rate had escalated up to 20 percent in the past few years. desalegn said banks were forced to transfer the lower interest rate of the nbe bill to customers."
"life seemed comfortable for abiy aschalew, when he found himself in the self declared state of somaliland. born in abergeleë a small wereda in amhara regional state, abiy initially dreamed of arriving in a middle eastern country.
human trafficking in ethiopia occurs internally and externally in the form of adult and child labor and sex trafficking. there are also reports of organ trafficking and other related human rights violations, like child marriage, and exploitation.
abiy, now in his mid-20’s, was unable to continue preparatory education due to poor grades so he chose to move to addis ababa to work and support himself and his family.
his father gave him 1,500 birr for transportation and other accommodations after convincing him to continue his education in an extension program and work during the day time.
economic insecurity and poverty often push families to look for alternative modalities to support the family, and demands for workers in weaving and farming have pulled children and women into human trafficking to meet these demands.
an international organization has reported that most traffickers are small local operators, often from the victims’ own communities, but that well-structured, hierarchical, organized crime groups are also responsible for irregular migrants becoming highly susceptible to trafficking. labor recruiters target young people from ethiopia’s vast rural areas with promises of a better life.
according to the study made by iom, labor trafficking is the most common form of exploitation in ethiopia, although sex trafficking has also been reported, and some researchers suggest that transnational adoption and organ harvesting should be investigated as a form of external trafficking including extensive concerns over the trafficking of women for domestic labor to countries east of the horn of africa.
“you can learn your class there, i will recruit you in the best café’ where you can earn handsome tips up to a hundred birr in half a day,” said a broker in his area who worked for two years in addis ababa and then moved to the gulf states after collecting money for the next journey.
for external trafficking, saudi arabia, lebanon, kuwait, the united arab emirates, yemen and of course europe are the destinations. however, the routes are in sudan, kenya, djibouti, and somaliland.
for those who are not successful at having a settled life in somaliland, like abiy, human trafficking is common. there are around 50 victims a day.
“the delay in implementing a legal agreement with uae on overseas employment contributed to the problem and benefits human traffickers,” said feleke belay, from the hargeisa consulate of ethiopia, adding that they are gravely concerned over the increasing number of illegal migrants entering somaliland.
people are heading to united arab emirates, via air arebia and fly dubai. large numbers of ethiopians are being deceived and lured by illegal agents so they flee the country and become engulfed in life risking journey, adds, deputy consul, feleke belay.
according to feleke, just a year after, the journey which is mostly from eastern part of the country they commonly are lured by false promises of smugglers, borders of somaliland accommodate hundreds of ethiopian migrants every day.
the plan to send ethiopians to uae is a short-term measure to reduce unemployment in ethiopia and to cope with increasing job demands, sending employees to one of its closest allies uae, even if, the agreements have not been realized so far. however, while many more ethiopians were waiting for the official agreements of the two countries, to travel to the gulf nation, the delay has created another loophole that the system to be easily exploited by human traffickers. several networked brokers extended from ethiopia to uae are becoming major players in facilitating the visa application for the draw-in job seekers, by processing from the uae embassy addis ababa, said the deputy consul. feleke indicated that a few weeks ago, the somaliland ethiopian consul received information of at least 90 ethiopians flying through the hargeisa airport via air arabia and fly dubai, due to official prohibition of ethiopian women traveling to uae via addis ababa.
feleke thinks the big headache is not about people who are flying illegally through the hargeisa airport by means of the human traffickers. however, there is another harsh situation where ethnically organized smugglers are torching ethiopians by dropping a piece of melting plastic on their body to let their families know the terrifying painful sound so they will send the money. surprisingly, there are smugglers settled in somaliland in a place named yogori and that is the place where migrants are held hostage and torched until they have received money from their relatives. some of the smugglers are armed and, feleke, noted that the latest rumble was between security forces and human traffickers.
accidents are common on the route, some weeks ago, at least 11 people died while the driver filled up 28 people in a minibus with a 12-person capacity.
“human traffickers are networked and camped in one of the border areas plus the money they receive from the hostage families through the bank.”
such acts are known by the government of ethiopia and there are times when the police force demolishes their temporary shelters in the boarder
travelers don’t have sufficient information regarding the issue. what they said is: “there is no job at home and we don’t have any other choice but to stay, said the deputy consul, noting that the desperate voices that he has heard while talking to travelers. the exact number of ethiopian refugees and migrants heading to somaliland is unclear, but large numbers of people are fleeing.
ethiopia has recently been identified as a country with a burgeoning human trafficking problem, although accurate rates of the number of trafficking victims are difficult to find the u.s. department of state said.
the exact size and extent of the problem is not known, but media, government, and advocacy groups have increasingly raised concerns over human trafficking in ethiopia in recent years.
families continue to play a major role in financing irregular migration, and may force or coerce their children to go abroad or to urban areas in ethiopia for employment.
the year 2019 has also seen a spike in arrivals of east african refugees and migrants there. latest estimates show that the monthly average of migrants arriving in yemen this year is 18,500, the highest number since data became available in 2006.
abiy and other ethiopians living in somaliland say they are content as the people of somaliland are friendly and respectful considering ethiopian gratitude during bad times of civil war but they still dream of traveling to gulf states."
"after promising they would do so for a year, the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) has repealed the controversial bill imposed on private banks, requiring them to buy 27 percent of bonds for every loan they disburse.
the ‘mfa/ nbebills/001/2011’ directive introduced in april 2011 forced banks to buy billions of birr worth of bonds from the central bank. the government took this action as a way of mobilizing resources for government targeted investment activities and these funds are administered by the development bank of ethiopia, the state owned policy bank.
the directive mandated that all banks except the commercial bank of ethiopia and development bank of ethiopia, both which are state owned, buy 27 percent of nbe bills for every loan disbursement at a five percent interest rate with a five-year maturity period.
banks have long complained the nbe bills shrink their liquidity and smash their capacity to provide loans for clients. they have also argued the 3 percent interest rate, which was attributed when the directive was issued and later increased to 5 percent in october 2017, was far below what banks pay as interest for the deposit. when the directive, ‘mfa/nbebills/001/2011’, became effective, the minimum interest rate was 5 percent and then increased to 7 percent a year ago when the birr was devalued by 15 percent. 
in the past during several discussions held with the government, including public private dialogue forums, the issue was one of the main topics brought up by the private sector. however, the government strongly defended and rejected the claim. international partners like the international monetary fund (imf) also expressed their concern about the directive, saying that the directive affected the private sector’s access to finance.
just a year ago, in his meeting with bankers a few months after he became governor of nbe, yinager dessie had promised the directive would be lifted.
when, at the meeting held on november 5, 2018, bankers expressed their concern about the directive, the governor disclosed that the central bank has created an exit strategy to lift the directive.
and, with its latest directive mfa/nbebills/004/2019, the central bank has repealed mfa/nbebills/003/2018 directive.
jules leichter, imf’s resident representative to ethiopia, told capital that it seems to be a positive step and that the imf definitely supports the move.
“the home grown economic reform plan has already noted this. in the past report of the imf, we have noted that this particular rule does hamper the ability of private banks to stimulate credit of the private sector,” the imf head in ethiopia explained.
“it consists of the government’s objective for the private sector to start picking more of the engine of growth,” leichter said.
“this relief has high importance, because the banks have been on liquidity constraint that was pushing them for unnecessary competition, while their lending capacity will also be improved,” eyob tesfaye, macro economist working for the un, told capital.
their lending capacity will boost the private sector and so it will be a good opportunity; as a slowdown was observed in the private sector but this decision will help them.
eyob underlined that it might not be on larger level, but this will help the private sector to access the finances that will lead better economic activity.
“it is unexpected and bold move despite it being late coming. for the finance industry it is big news,” dereje zebene, president of zemen bank said.
“in the past, several opinions were given regarding the issue; some think it pressured the banks’ liquidity; it makes the resource scares and push them to increase the interest rate which indirectly pressured other sectors,” he told capital.
dereje explained even though the government said the bill would be lifted, we were expecting that the lifting process would take place in several phases, “this is why i said it is a bold decision. now we are very grateful as this is not only for the banks but the pressure on borrowers will also be eased.”
with regards to issue of whether the government might come up with other instruments to control the loan, leichter said “my understanding is they are trying to allow the banks to do more financial intermediation to take deposit and to convert it to loan to the private sector. “so, i don’t know of any plan to replace to something similar; but of course what happens is the government has to work to improve its monetary policy framework,” he added.
according to the imf resident representative to ethiopia, as the 27 percent rule was taking some liquidity from the banks, so now they need to think about ways of modernization of the monetary policy framework to be able to manage the liquidity.
“i think this is also something the government is looking into, as to trying to strengthen its monetary policy,” he added.
inflation
some experts argued lifting the nbe bill might exacerbate the current rampant inflation.
eyob explained that one of the sources for inflation is through bank lending which is called money creation through fraction of reserve, and when banks pump credit it is going to be inflationary.
he recalled that one of the purposes of introducing the nbe bill was to curtail the inflation but it was not fruitful since the central bank pumped the money via another direction.
but, he argued, lifting the nbe bill might not significantly increase inflation even though it boosts banks’ capacity to provide more money to their customers.
“they are assuming due to harvest season, food prices will decline but i don’t think so,” he added.
the imf ethiopia head on his part says; “the inflation is obviously high; it is well above the government’s target and indeed its monetary policy, with or without this change, would need to think about lowering inflation.”
he said, this is an objective they would have, even without this reform. in the context of this reform which is the matter of looking at the whole monetary program and figuring out exactly what instrument they have and how they control the money supply at the right level to achieve lowering inflation. because i think, for ethiopia high inflation is something very costly. it is not much of an abstract economic concept. it actually hurts people; and so the government, i think, is committed to bring inflation down, and they have to look for tools and decide how they can achieve their monetary objectives.
on the other hand, experts argued that the nbe bill has contributed to the rise in inflation. one of the private banks’ president explained in anonymity that due to the interest rate of the bill which was lower than the market, the banks would compensate the difference by imposing more interest on their lending, which indirectly contributes for the inflation.
“besides the low liquidity due to the bill at the banks level, it also contributes to the scarcity of the resources,” the president told capital
dereje of zebene bank also said, if the cost of fund is increased, obviously the inflation would rise because lenders also transfer their cost to others. but now, he said, the liquidity will grow, so the cost of funding will be also harmonized.
he argued inflation will not occur due to lifting of the bill. “the banks finances that were withdrawn by nbe were also supplied to the market in another direction. the nbe instrument was not implemented to keep the money idle from the market; if that was the target the credit cap would have been implemented,” he said.
one of the arguments of the government to impose the nbe bill was that the private banks were not interested to provide long term loans for strategic sectors and hence it has to do it via the dbe.
it argued “strategic sectors, such as manufacturing and agro processing require long term and large loans. however, private banks are not interested in providing long term loans and also have limited capacity in providing large loans.” it claimed that due to this, it issued the directive to mobilize resources and facilitate access to long term and large loans for strategic sectors.
however, dereje argues that, “initially we are commercial banks, and by nature we focus on short term loans. besides, the government itself has issued a directive that forced banks to provide only 20 percent from their total loan disbursement for long term.
“so how could we bypass this directive?” he asks.
“in my view, the finance that the government collected from the banks and released on the market in unproductive ways has cost the country,” he added.
according to nbe directive mfa/nbebills/003/2018, from the total loan disbursement banks should provide 40 percent for short term, 40 percent for medium and the balance 20 percent for long term loans.
experts told capital that under the home grown economic reform plan, the government has targeted to facilitate different instruments to finance pro development policy projects. “the government wants to use various monetary instruments including reducing government borrowing to control the money supply and inflation,” these experts said.
according to the first quarter data of the 2019/20 financial year, the private banks bought close to 95 billion birr worth nbe bill.
the data indicates that dashen bank has purchased a huge amount of bill under the nbe directive. dashen purchased 12.6 billion birr worth of bill, followed by awash bank by 11.8 billion birr, and cooperative bank of oromia and bank of abyssinia by 8.9 and 8 billion birr respectively in the first quarter."
"the anticipated increase on excise tax has led to beer crates shortage at breweries due to sellers hoarding the products, capital learned.
the revised excise tax is expected to be ratified by the parliament in the near future.
one of the sectors that will be affected by the revised excise tax, which is also known as a sin tax levied mostly on luxury goods and items dangerous to people’s health is the alcohol industry. for instance, for the current budget year the ministry of revenue plans to collect 45.4 percent higher excise tax from breweries compared with the preceding year.
the government targets to amass 4.246 billion birr from the brewers in the budget year which is a 1.3 billion birr increase compared with the 2018/19 fiscal year.
sources at different breweries told capital that most of them are affected by the shortage of crates (bottle box).
sources said that currently there is high demand of products in the market but the factories can’t meet their demands because the crates are being returned more slowly than before.
sources said that sellers in the country on average have a capacity of 1,000 glasses holding, while they seem to be now hoarding more products in their warehouses.
businesspeople say sellers are holding on to the products a long time before they sell them. when the revised tax law is ratified the price of beer is expected to shoot up. “the distributers are waiting for the law to be ratified, which will bring a huge wind fall sum to their pocket,” they said. they further said that the distributors’ action has forced brewers to slow down their daily production.
the beer industry actors said that some of the brewers are trying their best to get their crates back by applying different tactics.
“for instance, one of the brewers started to give additional bonus crate of beer for those who come up with 15 empty crates,” sources said.
the excise tax, which is expected to contribute about 9 percent of the total tax collection this year, is the oldest tax in modern ethiopia’s history, first introduced in 1931, before the italian occupation, on excisable products such as alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, incense, carpets and clothes.
the highly anticipated law is expected to be ratified by the parliament by the coming month, while as the original plan the proclamation was expected to be applicable in november; but it was delayed so far.
as per the draft document capital was able to look at it appears that taxes on some goods will change and that new products will become eligible for the excise tax but details are not mentioned. previously an excise tax ranging from 10 to 100 percent was applied to 19 categories of products.
the government is encouraged by international partners like the world bank and international monetary fund to improve tax collection from the current 10 percent of the gdp ratio to at least up to peer countries in the region. in the sub sahara region, the average tax to gdp ratio is about 18 percent."
"donkeys are in a state of global crisis with the animals facing population collapse across a number of countries as traders target their skins to export as an ingredient for ejiao, a traditional chinese medicine, international animal welfare charity the donkey sanctuary revealed.
the charity’s latest report into the trade, under the skin update, has found that local donkey populations have crashed in a number of countries as increasing demand for ejiao has led to an unsustainable number of donkeys being slaughtered.
gelatine in donkey hides is a key ingredient in ejiao and the donkey sanctuary is now calling for an urgent halt to the largely unregulated global trade in donkey skins before donkeys are virtually wiped out in some areas.
the supply of donkey skins cannot meet demand in china, which needs around 4.8 million hides per-year for ejiao production, so traders, mainly in africa, asia and south america, are exporting additional skins to china.
donkey populations in china have collapsed by 76 percent since 1992. since 2007 donkey populations have declined by 28 percent in brazil, by 37 percent in botswana and by 53 percent in kyrgyzstan.
in kenya and ghana, both countries where the skin trade operates, donkeys are also being exploited by traders with fears that their numbers could be devastated in the near future.
with just under five million skins needed every year for ejiao production, the industry would need more than half the world’s donkeys over the next five years to meet demand.
the collapse of the donkey population will have a hugely damaging impact on the livelihoods of an estimated 500 million people in some of the world’s poorest communities that the animals support.
donkeys transport goods to market, carry water and wood, provide access to education and are a vital source of income for vulnerable communities, particularly women.
the report reveals appalling animal welfare abuses and biosecurity risks at every stage of the skin trade both in its legal and illegal forms.
tens of thousands of donkeys, many of whom are stolen, are rounded up to endure long journeys to slaughterhouses on crowded trucks without access to food, water or rest with an estimated 20 percent of animals dying en route.
demand for skins is so high that even pregnant mares and young foals as well as sick and injured donkeys are indiscriminately caught and transported, contrary to international animal welfare guidelines.
the report revealed that many skin trade donkey handlers have little or no training in animal handling, often resorting to cruel and illegal methods of controlling donkeys such as kicking, dragging and the use of spiked sticks called goads.
conditions in many of the donkey slaughterhouses are appalling. the naivasha slaughterhouse in kenya was immediately closed after witnesses recorded footage of dead and dying donkeys some with open, maggot-infested wounds. aborted foetuses were also seen as well as skinned carcasses dumped next to live donkeys awaiting slaughter. the slaughterhouse has since reopened.
in bahia, brazil, 800 donkeys were found starving to death in holding pens alongside hundreds of rotting carcasses which had polluted their only water source.
donkeys are often brutally slaughtered in front of other animals. footage obtained by the donkey sanctuary from a slaughterhouse in tanzania revealed animals being repeatedly hit with hammers in failed attempts to stun them.
the donkey sanctuary has also discovered links between the skin trade and wildlife crime, with some traders offering donkey skins for sale on online platforms that are also selling illegal wildlife products including ivory, pangolin scales and rhinoceros horn. in one instance, tiger skins were found hidden underneath donkey skins.
unhygienic practices during transport, in slaughterhouses and when the hides are processed onwards have resulted in an increased risk of the spread of dangerous diseases such as anthrax and equine diseases, equine flu and strangles.
more than 60,000 donkeys died in west africa this year along live skin trade routes, which the world organisation for animal health have said are almost certainly linked to the trade.
these deaths demonstrate the potentially high risk of contagious diseases being spread as a result of the skin trade. donkey skins from this area are being exported untreated direct to china.
mike baker, chief executive of the donkey sanctuary, said: “this is suffering on an enormous and unacceptable scale. this suffering is not just confined to donkeys as it also threatens the livelihood of millions of people.
“the skin trade is the biggest threat to donkey welfare we have ever seen. urgent action needs to be taken.”
stephen njoroge from kiserian, near nairobi, kenya, is totally dependent on his donkeys for his livelihood. he said: “i used my donkeys for general transport, collecting water, taking vegetables to market and carrying construction materials.
“my donkeys were very close together and were stolen in the same night, and i am still recovering from the loss. i have heard much about the donkey slaughterhouses and they are causing the donkey thefts in this area – they should be closed down straight away; it is the only way to stop the thefts.”
the donkey sanctuary is calling for the ejiao industry to cut links with the global skin trade and move towards more sustainable sources of raw materials provided by cellular agriculture such as the use of artificially grown donkey-derived collagen.
the charity is also recommending that the chinese government suspends the import of donkeys and their products until both can be proven to be disease free, humane, sustainable and safe and for national governments to take immediate steps to stop the trade.
ethiopia is home to an estimated 8.5 million donkeys – thought to be the largest number in any one country. current research from the university of bristol in the uk shows that owning a donkey in ethiopia can mean the difference between poverty and survival for some of the poorest communities in the country."
"the ministry of trade and industry (moti) warns that it will start taking action against those who attempt to export agricultural products under the price of the local market.
the ministry issued a directive on october 18 with the goal of controlling the export of agricultural products mainly traded at the ethiopian commodity exchange (ecx).
in the past couple of years the price of products like sesame seeds and pulses traded at ecx has been hiking against the international price on the aim that exporters that are at the same time engaged on the import business focus on the hard currency earnings for the import of the products that they trade here.
due to the price hike on the local market companies that focuses on the export business forced to leave their activity.
to tackle the challenge the moti has issued the ‘export contract registration and administration directive no.21 2019’ that targets control the export of products against international price. in the past exporters who export products except coffee only process their export via banks, while documents related with coffee should pass not only banks but the national bank of ethiopia.
in the directive that moti issued exporters should get permit from the directorate that was recently formed to control the export.
based on the new directive exporters should get the permit for export and the directorate is responsible to look the price of the product in accordance with the international market.
according to mesfin abebe, director of the crop products marketing directorate at moti, despite most of the traders started buying products as per the international price some illegal actors are still trying to go against the directive.
he told capital that some are trying to get a permit, while they bought the products against the international price.
“we refused to give them the permit that will be a lesson to correct their illegal acts,” he said.
“the previous trend has also contributed for the inflation since traders compensate their loss on the products they import. due to their illegal way the price of import products shraply hiked,” mesfin explained.
“since the directive become effective, export products price has declined at ecx; for instance the price of sesame seeds has declined from over 7,000 birr to 4,600 birr per quintal,” he added.
the directive has given the right for moti to penalize exporters that buy products over the international price. the penalty includes being suspended from trading to revoking the business license besides applying other legal processes.
sources told capital that relevant officers from moti and members of ethiopian pulses, oilseeds and spices processors – exporters association (epospea) discussed about the issue to start taking measures on illegal actors.
the ministry also announced that it will start taking action.
“since the directive become effective for the last almost one month we preferred to give advice for traders that buy products against international price and come to get permit from us to follow the rules that is stated on the directive,” mesfin said. “now we will start taking measures,” he added.
sources said that few weeks ago epospea wrote a letter for members saying that they should follow the proper way before the ministry starts taking legal action.
sources said that the issue was also raised on the meeting that was held this week between stakeholders from the ministry, export actors and regional representatives.
the main meeting for this week was to get on consensus about preventing hording, contraband and insure the smooth supply of products to the electronic trading centre, ecx.
mesfin said that the export sector is totally changed and is now considered as a subsidiary business for import business than profitable business.
“we have to make the export sector a profitable business as the past and we are working on it,” he added."
"the higher education relevance and quality assurance agency (herqa) under the ministry of science and higher education is awaiting the government’s decision over fake educational documents in gambela regional state. officials and civil servants in that region have been caught holding fake documents. apparently over a dozen schools have issued thousands of degrees without any accreditation from the agency.
“they joined in an institution with no accreditation and sadly they got a degree and were later promoted and even hold government offices with the wrong degree,” andualem admassie, director of herqa told capital in an exclusive interview.
programs are accredited by the agency for three years and then they must renew after five years. the agency looks at the program, location and teaching practice.
“i am afraid a lot of people who have graduated are not qualified to get that degree and close to 20 individuals came to the office on a daily basis to find solutions for their unaccepted degree,” he adds.
according to the director, many degrees across the country do not meet standards and this has created a huge problem. “some people have been willing victims because they know the school is unaccredited.”
in order to tackle the problem, the higher education relevance and quality assurance agency is currently working to introduce a modern database next month, to allow institutions verify authenticity of degrees, diplomas and certificates before recruiting employees.
a recent study made on civil servants in the southern region of ethiopia exposed 3,200 employees recruited in government institutions using forged credentials.
the agency has also taken action against 15 private colleges and higher-learning institutions in addis ababa for failing to meet regulatory requirements, which it says undermines the quality of education being delivered to students.
herqa is mandated in accreditation, reaccreditation, institutional and program level quality audit reports and the dissemination of good practice, is to help to enhance the provision of higher education in ethiopia and the confidence of all stakeholders in the quality of that provision.
the issues of quality in education is in a critical stage where a huge gap is witnessed in both government and private higher institutions the director says they are doing all they can to improve the situation."
"united insurance company sc (unic ethiopia) has registered massive achievements in the past fiscal year with 55 percent profit growth.
in its annual general assembly held at the ethiopian skylight hotel on thursday november 14, unic disclosed that its gross profit for the 2018/19 financial year stood at 121.2 million birr, which is one of the top in the industry.
the net profit stood at 106.6 million birr, which is a 55 percent growth compared with the preceding year’s insurance business or operation profit.
although in the 2017/18 financial year the company’s net profit stood at 123.7 million birr, meseret bezabih, ceo of unic, told capital that the previous year’s profit was high as the insurer had secured large revenue from the sale of its shares in raya brewery which bgi ethiopia fully took over last year.
“comparing the performance of the two years, that is the 2018/19 financial year’s operation with the 2017/18, in terms of insurance business, the latest year’s achievement is over half of the preceding year’s,” meseret clarified.
in the 2017/18 financial year, unic secured close to 56 million birr from its share sales at raya brewery, which is located in maiychew town, 667 km north of addis ababa. it has played a role in increasing the insurance company’s profit for the period.
according to the annual report of unic, the 2018/19 underwriting profit stood at 173.5 million birr, which was only 121 million birr in the 2017/18 performance period.
the report indicated that the net income of the past financial year expanded to 258.5 million birr when compared with the 237 million birr a year before last year.
one of the pioneer private insurance companies not only in terms of operation but also in terms of paid up capital, unic has registered several significant achievements for the past financial year.
for instance, the loss ratio has declined to 60 percent. the loss ratio for the year 2017/18 was 68 percent; that means the latest performance has declined by 8 percent, which is rare in the sector.
unic has also registered the highest premium compared with the industry average. for the reported year the company collected 533.6 million birr in premiums from both general and life businesses, which has increased by 13 percent compared with the preceding year. since the sector premium increase is 6 percent that indicates that unic’s premium growth trend was over double compared with the industry performance.
according to the company report , from the general (non life) insurance business unic was able to register close to 495 million birr premium that was 438 million birr a year ago and about 39 million birr from life sector. due to weak performance in the export /import business, the marine premium has declined, while other businesses grew during the period, according to the annual report.
during its 11th extraordinary meeting held a year ago shareholders agreed to double the company capital to half a billion birr that is one of the highest in the sector. of the 500 million birr capital, close to 375.6 million birr is paid up as of june 30, 2019.
based on the 2018/19 fiscal year that is closed on june 30, 2019 the total asset of unic has reached to 1.52 billion birr from 1.34 billion birr a year ago.
a week ago the company has inaugurated its head quarter located at tewodros square. this new facility increases the assets of the company that also owns two other buildings in addis ababa, in qality and bole medhanealem area and one in bahir dar. the 12 storey head quarter that has a unique set up of four basement parking areas rests on 2,000 square meters and consumed 300 million birr.
in its 25 year history, the company has settled over 1.7 billion birr in claims for its customers. at the same time the company has settled 7.5 million birr in claims for pvt (political violence & terrorism) insurance coverage, a product that was recently introduced in the country and very few other insurance companies offer.
unic was formed by less than 100 share buyers has now 478 shareholders, according to the annual report, while it has 50 branches including 12 contact offices. the company was formed in 1994 with a paid up capital of 8.1 million birr.
this year three insurers including unic and one bank celebrate their 25th anniversary in different programs."
"four hundred and nine people have been arrested in connection with violence which took the lives of 78 people last week largely in the oromia region. although not limited to these cities, places like dire dawa and harrar saw massive property damage and civilian casualties after a facebook post by jawar mohammed concerning removal of his security team.
the prime minister’s press secretary, nigussu tilahun, said there would have been more fatalities if some social groups hand not worked to calm the situation down.
many of the attacks were based on ethnic and religious identity. nigussu said the government acted immediately to control the situation.
anarchy was observed in the violations, according to nigussu. he said it may seem the government does not have the capacity to control problems. “the government has the capacity but instead prefers to be tolerant instead of prosecuting people like was done in previous times.” we have observed attempts to create disparity between groups of people. this problem is best solved by using wisdom by including elders, religious leaders and influential social groups.
the press secretary criticized the involvement of non patricians in the ruling coalition agenda. “the coalition issue is an internal issue and no one can give guidance for its strategy and operation,” he added. the coalition that has four ethnic based parties is working to create a single party by including five regional based ethnic parties that were considered supporters of the ruling collation, eprdf.
the formation of single party has been a long term goal and the mekele eprdf congress agreed to undertake study stressing that the hawassa congress that held after the assignment of abiy ahmed as chair of the coalition."
"the international monetary fund’s (imf) regional economic outlooks predicts modest economic growth of around 3.2 percent, in most sub-sahara african countries during 2019.
the imf writes that growth remains too low to meet the needs of growing populations.
imf division chief, papa n’ diaye, and catrine purfield, deputy director of imf rolled out the bi-annual report on thursday october 31 at the united nations economic commission of africa (uncea).
security issues are hampering domestic growth. imf previously recommended reforms to attract foreign direct investment which requires that people feel safe.
growth in sub-saharan africa is projected to remain at 3.2 percent in 2019 and rise to 3.6 percent in 2020. this is a slower recovery than expected for around two-thirds of the countries in the region, partly due to a challenging external environment.
growth is projected to remain strong in non-resource-intensive countries, averaging about 6 percent. as a result, 24 countries, home to about 500 million people, will see their per capita income rise faster than the rest of the world. in contrast, growth is expected to move in slow gear in resource-intensive countries (2.5 percent). hence, 21 countries are projected to have per capita growth lower than the world’s average. reducing risks and promoting sustained and inclusive growth across all countries in the region requires carefully calibrating the near-term policy mix, building resilience, and raising medium-term growth.
growth is forecast to be slower than previously envisaged for about two-thirds of the countries in the region. the downward revision reflects a more challenging external environment, continued output disruptions in oil-exporting countries, and weaker-than-anticipated growth in south africa.
growth prospects vary considerably across countries in the region in 2019 and beyond.
sub-saharan economic activity needs to pick-up, but at a slower pace. however, more job creation is needed in order to absorb new entrants which are more than 20 million labor markets every year.
according to the report, advance economic diversification, increasing medium-term growth, promoting private sector investment, comprehensively tackling tariffs and non-tariff barriers in the context of the afcfta, enhancing competition and developing value chains.
domestic debts negatively impact private sector activity and the delivery of social services while increasing banking sector vulnerabilities and undermining citizens’ trust in the government. unpaid debts also weaken the ability of fiscal policy to support growth, casting doubt on the merit of relying on debt financing to avoid spending cuts.
debt reduction, (verification, prioritization, liquidation) and to preventing accumulation, through public financial management reforms, building buffers, and timely external supports is recommended, although policy recommendations are country specific."
"the sugar scarcity saga shows no signs of slowing in ethiopia. in september the country’s nine regions and two city administrations received 390,000 quintals of sugar. this is 130,000 quintals less than the previous ration.
seven sugar factories are undergoing maintenance and there are 36,000 metric tons of sugar being imported from algeria.
previously each household would receive 5 kilos of sugar per month from the consumer association but now that has been reduced to two kilos.
a kilo of sugar goes for between 20 birr and 30 birr in shops but is seldom available. quotas for almost every area were down in september. in quintals this is a list of what each area received previously and what they received last month.
addis ababa 120,000 to 46,000, dire dawa 11,860 to 2,000, oromia 152,000 to 25,000, amhara 109,000 to 18,000, tigray 47,000 to 9,000, snnpr 69,000 to 17,400. afrar and harare below 2,000 quintals, from an undisclosed previous amount but reports say it is around half as much.
somali 24,152, benishangul-gumuz 4,500, gambela 8,000. these were unchanged from previous amounts but that is because they did not receive their previous supply due to technical issues.
solomon bekle, commodity exchange head at the addis ababa trade bureau told capital that the supply cut will clearly disturb the market.
“as far as we know, the consumer association plans 50 percent supply cuts to households and we are controlling the market to prevent price gouging. i think the problem will be solved when the imported sugar arrives and factories restart operations.”
the sugar corporation expects the product to reach ethiopia by november."
"thirty international companies from 10 countries who were expected to showcase products and technology at the millennium hall were forced to make way for the prime minster’s book launch.
the hall had been booked a year ago for the fifth edition of the livestock exhibition, through addis park for the expo organized by parana events and a sudanese expo team for service.com ltd. 
however, a loophole in the contract which mandates that the hall be vacated for an ‘urgent affair’, allowed the addis park managers to tell organizers to leave the hall because it was needed for the inauguration of prime minister abiy ahmed’s new book ‘medemer’ (synergy).
the exhibitors had planned to showcase for three consecutive days but instead they were forced to relocate to kolfe kerano subcity, inside the premises of midroc ethiopia’s compound called keranio plaza.
“international expos like this would not be hindered in the rest of the world unless there was a declared state of emergency. it really hurts ethiopia’s business tourism industry,” said nebyu lemma, managing director of prana events.
however, pm abiy during the book launch acknowledge the mistake and apologized officially to the organizers.
prana events hosts around 5 international expos annually.
“international exhibitors are disappointed and have left the country despite attempts to relocate them,” the manager said.
according to him, they tried to work with the ministry of trade and industry as well as the ministry of agriculture but their complaints fell on deaf ears as a result he fears many of these global companies will be reluctant to return to ethiopia next year.
the expo at the hall was only open for one day, thursday october 17, and closed at 6pm.
nebyu said that us companies were particularly frustrated and that this hurts the country’s image.
capital learned that the ceremony at millennium hall is organized by the addis ababa city administration.
more than 100 companies from 10 countries including netherlands, sudan, china germany, india and usa attended the event along with local companies. it features all kinds of agricultural products including unique animal feed.   "
"in ethiopia, children’s risk of dying before age 5 varies more than three-fold an unprecedented study mapping child deaths over almost two decades finds that the likelihood of a child reaching age 5 varies more than three-fold among zones in ethiopia.
the study finds that in ethiopia, 198,492 children died before their fifth birthdays in 2017, as compared to 430,852 in 2000. the highest mortality rate at the zone level in 2017 was 89.3 in afar zone 1. the lowest was 29.3 in addis ababa. neonatal disorders were the biggest cause of deaths before age 5 in both 2000 and 2017, according to the global burden of disease study, but the total number of deaths decreased by more than 30 percent during the study period. diarrhea and respiratory infections were also major contributors to child deaths.
the study is the first of its kind, mapping child deaths in 99 low- and middle-income countries at the level of individual districts, provinces, and municipalities. published today in the journal nature, the findings include precision maps illuminating health disparities within countries and regions often obscured by national-level analyses. an interactive visualization accompanying the research compares child death rates from year to year.
the research, conducted by the institute for health metrics and evaluation (ihme) at the university of washington’s school of medicine, looks at countries where more than 90% of child deaths occurred in 2017. across all countries studied, the likelihood of a child dying before age 5 varied more than 40-fold at the district level.
researchers estimated that if every district in the low- and middle-income countries studied had met the sustainable development goal (sdg) target of at least as low as 25 child deaths per 1,000 live births, 2.6 million fewer children would have died. if every district within a country rose to the level of the best-performing district in that country, the estimated number of deaths averted rises to 2.7 million.
the vast majority of the 17,554 districts among the 99 nations studied saw improvement in lowering child deaths, but levels of inequality between districts were more variable over the study period. despite major gains in reducing child deaths over the past 20 years, the highest rates of death in 2017 were still largely concentrated where rates were highest in 2000.
“it is as reprehensible as it is tragic that, on average, nearly 15,000 children under age 5 die every day,” said dr. simon i. hay, the senior author on the study and director of the local burden of disease (lbd) group at ihme. “why are some areas doing so well, while others struggle? in order to make progress, we need to enable precise targeting of interventions, such as vaccines. our findings provide a platform for nations’ health ministers, clinicians, and others to make focused improvements in health systems.”
the study, funded by the bill & melinda gates foundation, reveals areas of success where strategies could be replicated across and within countries, according to dr. hay.
for example, in rwanda, the highest district-level rate of child deaths in 2017 was less than half that of the lowest district-level death rate in 2000 – gains partially attributed to investments in children’s health in the poorest communities, expansion of health insurance, and increasing numbers of community health workers. nepal significantly decreased inequalities among its districts over the study period. and peru made major strides in reducing child mortality and inequality after implementing sustained, cross-cutting antipoverty and health programs.
the study estimates both rates and absolute numbers of deaths by district, presenting a complete picture of global child mortality that illuminates important trends and patterns.
a growing proportion of child deaths are occurring in areas with low overall death rates. neonatal mortality (death occurring in a child’s first 28 days) and infant mortality (death inthe first year of life) are both increasing as a percentage of total child deaths. these trends highlight the need for tailored approaches.
hay and his research team are working toward more detailed mapping of factors that influence child survival, including education, malnutrition, and disease prevention, in order to better understand the specific obstacles faced in different regions."
"political advocacy groups and electoral elites are expressing concern about the lack of security in some parts of ethiopia. they say it could hinder the upcoming election. the government says there are no plans to postpone the 2020 election even though some areas of ethiopia are under command post control while others have been disabled from attacks.
during a recent dialogue organized by the national electoral board of ethiopia (nebe) in collaboration with friedrich ebert stiftung under the title: ‘election and political parties proclamation of ethiopia’ senior members of nebe expressed their concern that if more steps weren’t taken ensure a peaceful climate, it could negatively impact the next election.
the way things are now is making it difficult for all sides to get their views heard, members of the civic association said, adding that the instability affects the election process and fair competition.
the civic society members appreciate the government’s decision encourage civic society to be active in the election process, which was suspended after the 2005 election. they are happy to play a role in a free and fair election process to improve the democratization process. according to them, the peace issue affects their ability to contribute to the election.
some of the minority parties say the recently amended electrical proclamation is a challenge for them. the proclamation requires national parties to come up with at least 10,000 signatures to get on the ballot. smaller parties argue that the unstable conditions make it difficult for them to get 10,000 signatures, a dramatic increase from the previous number of 3,000.
since the proclamation was amended during the extraordinary meeting at the parliament last summer, some of the small parties say that the rules create a rigged system where they can’t compete on the same playing field. however, other parties are happy with the rules.
sudden attacks and instability have occurred in various parts of ethiopia. last week there were killings in snnp and afar. some political parties are reluctant to campaign in towns where unrest may occur, which also presents a challenge for future elections
the election is expected to be held during may 2020. following the massive reform operation by the ruling eprdf almost all parties who were also categorized as terrorist organizations have entered the country to compete peacefully."
"the closing of the weighed facility at the bure warehouse at the ethiopian commodity exchange (ecx) forced traders to load their products on trucks for over ten days.
traders that capital talked said that since september 25 the weigh facility at bure has stopped services due to technical problems.
they said that even though ecx has information about the problem it did not work to correct it. traders who wanted anonymity told capital that due to the disruption the weigh trucks have been forced to wait at the center for almost two weeks.
“as a solution an optional small weight has been provided but labour who moves grains from trucks to warehouses are asking for additional payment for every bag, which are mostly 100 kilograms,” traders said.
this is unacceptable since it will increase the cost of the product and make it unfeasible compared with the selling price, according to traders.
they complained that the product mainly soybeans is not getting ecx warehouse in the past two weeks that makes the price to hike in the trading floor that is located at the heart of addis ababa, around mexico square.
according to people working in the business, the price of the commodity has increased by about 160 birr in the past few days. the ecx october 1 trading data shows that bure soybeans sold for up to 1,685 birr per quintal. “as a result, there is a scarcity of the product at the ecx warehouse and the price has gone up,” one of the traders expressed. he said the price was about 1,500 birr per quintal before the problem happened at bure.
he expressed his concern that if the problem is not solved shortly the price of their product might significantly drop. “the product stacked at bure was harvested during the past season but the new harvesting has arrived so our product might lose value,” a trader waiting to move his product said.
they said all actors like traders, transporters and truck owners are being affected.
netsanet tesfaye, public relation head at ecx, told capital that the case has been identified. “we are using leased weigh at bure so far i have information that the equipment that will replace the existing machine has arrived at djibouti port and its expected the operation will recommence by tomorrow,” he said.
ecx, the electronic trading floor, has commenced the exclusive trading of soybean late last year. since then the trading and export of the bean has shown significant growth. bure that is located 410km northwest of addis ababa is one of the 21 warehouses ecx operates. it has a capacity of 100,000 quintals of grain, while the biggest facility is located at humera, 988km northwest of the capital, with a capacity to handle 350, 000 quintals."
"the federal police are going after people illegally distributing unsafe bottled water, capital learned.
sources in the water industry told capital that the federal police are collaborating with stake holders, and police in oromia and addis ababa. they have been conducting investigations, mainly along the outskirts of the city.
according to sources, last week the federal police began prosecuting suspects at several production sites. they are sill in the process of arresting other perpetrators.
capital previously reported some of the 80 water bottling companies around addis ababa are producing unsafe water. in addition to illegally packing the water, there is a chain between input and label producers and distributors. in their annual meeting of the ethiopian bottled water and soft drinks manufacturing industries association (ebwsdmia) the issue was hotly debated.
assembly participants said they have seen many illegal bottlers operating on the outskirts of addis ababa. not only are they using below standard plastic packaging, they are also putting not-potable water into the bottles.
association leaders told members they are following the case with federal, city and regional security forces. the assembly leaders of ebwsdmia alerted bottlers to follow their sales and marketing staff who might be working in cahoots with fake water producers.
ashenafi merid, general manager of ebwdmia, declined to give details about the federal police’s latest mission. “i can’t give details since the case is not finalized,” he told capital.
capital’s effort to get further information from the federal policy public relation division was unfruitful.
the association, which recently merged with soft drink and juice packing association has more than 100 members with over 50,000 employees."
"the addis ababa city administration has lifted the heavy-duty truck restriction for daylight hours on saturday. starting july 8, the administration imposed restrictions on truck movement in the city during the daytime until 8:00pm to reduce traffic in the capital. medium sized trucks, like those with a capacity of 3.5 tons or less were excluded. now, however all trucks can move freely in addis on saturday.
semere jelalu, traffic safety and management deputy head at addis ababa city transport programs management office, told capital that since the ratification of the directive trucks were not allowed to move through the city between 6:30 am and 8pm except on sunday and holidays.
“now we have added saturday and sunday and holidays for trucks to drive in the day time in the city,” semere said.
several businesses said their work was negatively impacted by the directive.
because most intercity transportation requires traveling through addis ababa the new law forced those shipping goods across the country, to wait on the edge of the capital until night. others like exporters of fresh goods including flowers and meat exporters were disappointed by the city’s decision. they claimed that their products were perishable and suffered from the delay. most of the flower farms and abattoirs are out of the city but need to transport their product to bole international airport every day for export.
even though most of the businesses have expressed their opinions, the ethiopian bottled water and soft drinks manufacturing industries association (ebwsdmia) has come up with concrete evidence showing the advantage and disadvantage to the water industry.
according to the information from ebwsdmia, the study is undertaken by professionals from addis ababa university and the outcome submitted to the ministry of trade, ministry of transport, office of the prime minister and city transport bureau.
the study argued that bottlers stock increased at their production site because they did not have ample time to distribute the product since some of the industries were forced to halt one of the three production shifts followed by layoffs of one third of the employees.
they also expressed the concern that it is not easy to do business at night because of security problems, and infrastructure like adequate street lights banks and labor issues.
“the study insists that small trucks up to 3.5 tons of capacity run in the city from 10 am to 4 pm. this means it pushes bottlers to expand the number of small trucks for product distribution which increased the number of vehicles in the road,” ashenafi merid, head of the association said.
the study that capital reviewed recommended that at least medium trucks should be allowed for such kind of business or the hour limits be reduced either in the morning or nighttime.
ashenafi told capital that the association leaders have gotten the chance to meet and explained the barriers for several city and federal officials including girma birru, macro economic advisor of the prime minister.
he believed that the current decision of the city administration allowing trucks to move on saturday is a good contribution for the economy."
"the lowest rates were offered for the first public private partnership (ppp) independent power purchase (ipp) of two scaling solar schemes, but bidders are complaining.
on friday, september 6 bid opening, only one company produced a financial proposal for the two solar power projects, while four other companies were involved in the bid process and offered their proposal.
however, the evaluation of the technical document suspended the opening of a financial offer from the companies including: enel green power/orchid, edf/masdar consortium, frv/ globeleq/ belayab consortium, and al-nowais/ aldwych/ alten consortium.
during the financial opening, a proposal from acwa power, a saudi firm, was the only contender.
as per its financial offer the company gave usd 0.252/kwh for the gaad scheme in the somali region and usd 0.0598/kwh on the dicheto scheme in the afar region.
the amount was the lowest tariff compared with similar projects on the continent and one of the lowest globally.
on wednesday september 11 the ppp board in its extraordinary meeting held at the ministry of finance approved the winner of project that will generate 125mw each at both sites.
teshome tafesse, state minister of finance, told capital that the bid process has shifted to the next stage.
there are companies complaining about the bidding process, while the state minister said that the claim shall be submitted in the seven days since the board disclosed the bid result.
he added that so far complaints have not been submitted. if is there are any, they will be evaluated based on the process, according to teshome.
experts said that the company might manage the project for twenty years with an optional five year extension. teshome said that the details will be discussed after they speak with the client, ethiopian electric power. he said that the project might take 18 months from start to finish.
the international finance corporation (ifc), the world bank’s private sector wing, which promised to finance the projects, excluded itself on the day before the opening of the bid due to the government refused to give convertibility guarantee for the debt that ifc provides for investors.
sources stated that initially the project was backed by the international finance corporation (ifc), which attracted several prominent firms.
experts said scaling solar is the ifc scheme implemented in other african countries. based on the agreement with mof, the ethiopian scaling program was also developed via the concept, procedure and support of ifc. ifc also agreed to provide the finance at an attractive interest rate to realize the project, which made bidders more confident.
“based on national bank of ethiopia (nbe) foreign currency guideline it has stated that the government would not give convertibility guarantee and based on the country law there is not convertibility guarantee for the private sector investment,” teshome explained.
he added that it shall be bound by the agreement with the client from the government side and the private sector. “this does not mean that the private sector will not access the finance and change it to foreign currency to service its debt as per the ppp guideline,” he argued saying that the under ppp the private sector will get the finance in foreign currency to settle the debt and other services.
“in the past the private sector wing of the world bank has provided finance to the private sector in the country without a convertibility guarantee from the government. the current demand is not acceptable. it seems like leverage to change the country’s policy. we led the technical support and knowledge transfer as much as possible on wise manners, and now we stand at the level to handle international level ppp without their support,” he said.
he said that the implication that the offer of a lower tariff is the result of our effort to expand the ppp in the country and the current government’s initiative to improve the economic sector in different directions. the fair and transparent competition and bidding process is the crucial point for the lowest tariff that shall compare with the previous similar trend in the sector.
from the compliant side sources said that some of the companies sent a delegation or are managing the issue via their country’s embassy here. bidders said that the withdrawal of ifc happened a few days before the opening of the bid so it is difficult for bidders to come up with alternative financers in that short period. bidders also claimed that the process is not transparent; meanwhile the government argued that process was clear.
“acwa power, which came up with finance from chinese sources, said at the financial offer that it will discuss with the government on the convertibility guarantee that means it should be disqualified from the process,” sources said.
in june 2019 the 49 percent share of acwa secured by silk road fund that was given to exports that the company will come with the finance from china.
experts in the area assured that the offer of the company is very fair. “the risk in other country and ethiopia is different. the political and financial risk from one to other is different. regarding financial risk of our case it is convertibility. this raises the question of realistic issue on the project in relation with the offered tariff,” experts said."
"it is said that in the past ethiopian year the banking industry have seen senior bankers reshuffle from one to other.
the issue has been attached with the hiring of new top management in different banks that include big private banks, according to sector actors.
experts in the banking industry argued that it is because of adapting a new system and applying the recommendation of consultancy firms that develop a strategic plan for the banks.
these experts said that the financial sector has been changing over the last years. they argued that to some extent it might be related to the political change. “when banks implement a new strategy a crowd of senior experts moves to that institution,” they said.
people who work at the banks say that new management is not considering in-house talent but instead is opting to hire people from outside.
“hiring people other than the professionals in the company is the other reason senior staff are leaving their firms and looking for jobs in other banks,” one of the senior bankers said.
he said that open positions in banks have become common and as a result banks are also losing their staff when existing experts move from one bank to the other.
sources said “if you see bank of abyssinia (boa) most of the new senior management staff are new and come from the state owned commercial bank of ethiopia (cbe) that the current president of boa, bekalu zeleke, had led for many years.”
at the same time the senior staff at cbe came from other private banks like awash bank after bacha gina took the helm at the commercial bank of ethiopia, according to sources.
the financial industry is on the top in regards to profit compared with other industries. the sector is also growing aggressively in relation to recently applied rules of the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) and tough competition between banks.
“even though the sector is dramatically growing in the past half a decade the labour market is not providing strongly qualified professionals,” experts argued.
according to them that might be the other reason the senior staffs are moving from one bank to the other.
they said regarding losing highly qualified experts the state owned financial giant is the major victim. mostly banks are taking cbe staff because they are highly trained by the government and have wide experience."
"chinese textile product manufacturer, sunshine ethiopia wool manufacturing company, is set to increase its investment portfolio in ethiopia to 980 million usd.
the chinese textile firm, which has been part of the adama industry park since 2016 has a registered investment capital of 350 million usd, but plans to further increase its investment capital in ethiopia to 980 million usd as part of its second phase investment.
chen min, general manager of sunshine ethiopia wool has indicated that the planned investment would be important for the company’s current exportportfolio.
the general manager, however, voiced his concern over recurrent electric power interruption as a major bottleneck affecting the company’s manufacturing chain.
“the ongoing frequent electric power interruption has led the factory to greater performance uncertainty in its ambition to expand its business,” the manager adds.
the general manager also noted that there are times that the factory encountered total blackouts for five or more days, eventually halting operations inside the plant.
“such power issues are hampering the factory’s production capacity, and hundreds of employees are stranded inside the factory awaiting the return of light which has an effect on efficiency,” chen said.
in addition to challenges attributed to recurrent power cuts, investors also expressed their concern over the waste-water treatment scheme at the adama industry park.
previously the government assured investors it would be finished on time but that has not been the case.
“it poses another challenge to our factory because we can’t afford trucks to transport 260 tons of industrial waste every day or to take out waste from the factory,” chen said.
the textile firm, when operating under normal circumstances, has an annual production capacity of 10 million metric ton of wool fabrics, according to the general manager.
ephreme bekle, operation manager of adama industrial park, told capital that they are aware of the situation and will solve the problem
the industrial park was built by china civil engineering construction company, and is part of the ethiopian government’s grand plan to transform the country’s largely agrarian economy into an industrialized one by 2025.
covering 100 hectares of land and built at a cost of around 146 million usd. it was inaugurated by prime minister abiy ahmed."

the fate of those sent to maekelawi – except for the more high-profile detainees – was largely unknown to the outside world. opening up its gates in the new year and offering the public a glimpse of its brutal reality may help some former detainees deal with the trauma they endured.
the decision for closure of the notorious prison was passed by former prime minister hailemariam desalegne."
"the ministry of trade and industry says illegal traders are behind the double-digit rise in inflated prices of consumer goods. participants at a meeting this week asked the government for a crackdown on illegal actors.
stakeholders at the intercontinental hotel pointed to hoarding and shady dealers.
the ministry held talks on a study they conducted saying that since december last year prices have been rising and by august they had gone up 15 percent, primarily due to hoarding.
“the ongoing inflation observed has no relationship with economic factors rather it is driven by economic sabotage via traders, and other actors in the supply chain,” said fetlework gebreegziabheir, minister of trade and industry.
the study identified intervention of ‘middlemen’, a manufactured shortage of supplies of consumption goods, conducting transactions illegally and weak capacities of unions and associations as causes for the price hike on consumer goods. the participants said the government must come up with better, long-lasting solutions. 
the ministry argues that there is no shortage of consumer goods but merchants are increasing prices pretending that there is one.
inflation has risen with regard to both food and non-food items. however, fruits and vegetables, bread and other necessities have skyrocketed over the last few months.
“the inflation mainly hurts low-income people living in urban areas”, she adds.
the ministry plans to alleviate the problem by controlling illicit trade, engaging more in import substitution and adequately supplying locally produced consumer products.
representatives of the attending associations responded by urging the government to support local producers so they can make more edible oil and other vital products. they also wanted the government to prosecute middlemen and other brokers acting unscrupulously.
the government recently established a high level committee to combat the rampant inflation."
" new research warns that african consumption of illegal drugs is projected to become a public health emergency.africa faces a substantial increase in illegal drug use, fuelled by organised crime and ineffective policy. in the next 30 years, sub-saharan africa will see the world’s biggest surge in illicit drug users, with its share of global drug consumption projected to double.
this is according to comprehensive new research and analysis of africa’s drug trade, policy and future consumption trends by the enact transnational organised crime programme. enact is a partnership between the institute for security studies (iss), interpol and the global initiative against transnational organised crime (gi), funded by the european union. the research was released in addis ababa on thursday 5 september.
it is anticipated that by 2050 there will be an additional 14 million africans using illegal drugs, with a total of 23 million users in sub-saharan africa. the continent has also dominated a global expansion of non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids, with 87% of global seizures in 2016.
east africa will experience the sharpest increase in the proportion of its population using illicit drugs, and west africa is set to remain the continent’s largest regional drug market.
west africa’s role has also expanded as a global trafficking hub for drugs, particularly cocaine. the region’s drug users will more than double from about 5.7 million in 2018 to 13 million in 2050. an underground economy has developed around the production and distribution of methamphetamines, particularly in nigeria.
africa’s dangerous drugs phenomenon is driven by weak regulation and organised criminals operating across national borders. it is assisted by global production of cocaine and heroin to levels the 2018 world drug report says are the highest ever recorded.
a growing heroin economy has emerged from the international drug smuggling route down the east coast of africa for shipment to international markets.
drug use threatens african health and national development, enact said. the drug trade, fuelled by organised crime, corrupts democratic institutions and threatens the achievement of the sustainable development goals. african consumption of illegal drugs is projected to become a public health emergency but the continent has a dramatic inability to meet demand for treatment. for example, 2017 data revealed that 40% of high-risk drug users in nigeria wanted treatment but were unable to access it.
the african union (au) and its regional economic communities need to act urgently to address the drug challenge, said eric pelser, enact programme head at the iss. ‘illegal drug use poses a formidable law enforcement and public health problem to governments in africa,’ he said.
use of injected drugs like heroin risks another spike in hiv and other diseases, and the growing significance of africa as a drug transportation hub will place enormous strain on law enforcement.
participation in drug trafficking offers political, security and business leaders windfall profits, says gi’s mark shaw, an organised crime expert. ‘they can conduct electoral and security campaigns, feed patronage systems, or take a fast track to wealth and power. in turn, politicians and security leaders can offer traffickers protection or even assistance.’
african drug markets are becoming ever more sophisticated and increasingly take advantage of secure innovations such as blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and trading platforms on the dark web.
disproportionate harm from poor policy
african drug policy is complex and controversial, and previous attempts to respond to drug trade and consumption have done a disproportionate amount of harm with limited results.
securitised responses have had unintended consequences. drugs became a revenue source for terrorist organisations, national prison populations expanded and generations of young people were disenfranchised by criminal convictions for low-level drug crimes.
continental drug markets continued to expand even as illicit crops were destroyed, drug users imprisoned, illicit labs dismantled, and drug shipments seized. there is a growing evidence base for the human and economic costs of the failing ‘war on drugs’, with health institutions and civil society voices pushing for a new direction in drug policy.
most drugs remain illegal across much of the continent, but there is a wide discrepancy in how they are policed and controlled. the traditional consensus on full prohibition by african governments is breaking down and some states now recognise legalisation of drugs as a more effective approach, with au and national policy makers tackling africa’s drug challenge with evidence-based policies which include law enforcement, social welfare and public health.
enact made a number of policy recommendations. it said effective responses must reduce production and trafficking of drugs, coupled with demand reduction and expanded healthcare for treatment of drug users. data collection and monitoring of drug use should be expanded and coordinated, and the stigma removed from drug use and the need for treatment.
all regions of the continent should bolster their intelligence-led cross-border law enforcement to curb supply and production of illicit drugs, targeting traffickers rather than users.
interpol has been supporting the establishment of analytical units in a number of african countries and developing capacity to address the drugs issue. this approach has already proven to be effective as these units have started to produce their own analytical products. pilot countries have also expressed their will to disseminate the culture and method of criminal intelligence analysis, using their analysts to provide training within police schools."
"tigray regional state says it is not happy with the new educational road map that will be rolled out next ethiopian academic year because they say it threatens the federal system and the constitution.
the new educational road map will reintroduce a 6-2-4 system next year replacing the 8-2-2 system introduced some 20 years ago.
based on a report, the tigray region rejected the recommendation from the ministry of education to teach students amharic which is the federal government’s working language.
“we will not teach amharic from grade one on as it creates confusion with the students in differentiating the sounds because both amharic and tigrigna language use the same letters,” said bahita w/michael, head of tigray education bureau.
“the issue of teaching languages is subjected to the respective regional states but the road map recommends teaching amharic which is the federal language from grade one on, adding that the road map is just a recommendation,” the ministry of education said.
currently amharic learning starts in third grade in tigray and in fifth grade in oromia and the education road map allows students to be taught in their mother tongue between grade 1-8.
last week, shimeles abdissa, president of oromia regional state also expressed his discontent with the proposed education road map to teach the amharic language from grade one on.
“no negotiation over the oromo language, the recommendation for students to take the federal working language as a subject matter in school is just ridiculous” shimeles said.
however, the educational road map is under discussion in the somali regional state in the presence of all stakeholders to have more input.
for mustafa mohammed omar, president of somalia regional state, the recommendation to teach amharic as one subject matter in classes is an added advantage, not a liability and it does not go against one’s own identity rather creates a common understanding.
one of the architects of the new education road map professor tirusew tefera says there are about 30 recommendations studied by the team and it all depends on the interest of the regions."
"twenty-three people have been arrested for stealing over 300 million birr by creating fake checking accounts at both private banks and the commercial bank of ethiopia.
the addis ababa police commission, who carried out the arrests said most of the money was stolen from chinese companies using bank accounts. detectives said the suspects stole 140 million birr from cbe using forged checks, targeting cbe branches in addis ababa, adama and debere birhan.
private banks including dashen, oromia international and others were also victims. they lost over 160 million birr through the fraudulent actions. the crimes were done at different times and involved repeat offenders.
the federal general attorney reported that the suspects had a connection with the bank and ethio telecom workers allowing them to rip the banks off.
“the suspects had people in the banks to tell them which companies and individuals had a large amount of money in the bank accounts. they would then prepare documents and checks, acting like the original owner of the accounts had ordered them to withdraw the money. telecom and bank staff would collaborate by diverting calls and approving documents.”
“people working for ethio telecom would divert a call allowing them to appear to be calling from a bank. then when bank cashiers attempt to call the owner of the account instead they would get the criminal who would order them to withdraw the money,” a source in the federal attorney general’s office said.
abiy tsegaye, the suspected mastermind of the heist, has left the country and police are working with interpol to capture him. three suspects are employed by ethio telecom and two by the banks. the suspects appeared at lideta high court in the middle of august and are due back in court in october. five charges have been filed against them including cheating the government and fabricating false checks and documents and stealing a large sum of money. other suspects are still at large."
"the council of ministers has cancelled the audit gap of selected federal public offices. the office of the federal auditor general (ofag) annually reported billions of birr of uncollected revenue, receivables or unsettled debts.
according to the ministry of finance’s annual report (mof), the government has annulled 290 million birr in receivables mentioned in ofag’s annual audit report as discrepancies observed since 2005. the money revoked by the council covers 18 public offices.
according to haji ibsa, public relations head of mof, based on a mandate from the council of ministers they also cancelled 119.3 million birr from 42 public offices. the ministry revoked a total of 395 million birr in receivables from 60 offices.
haji said most of the cancelations came about because of deviations between what was seen in annual audit reports from ofag and what actually existed.
higher education institutions had the most audit problems. “from the total 60 offices more than 60 percent are higher education institutions,” he explained. most of the issues revolved around unexplained expenses such as buying a coffin for a dead student that was not included on the expenditure list. instead that money went to other items.
haji said the government has improved the expenditure directive of unlisted expenses observed in universities and diplomatic missions which are the other major public offices with audit discrepancies.
according to haji, the council of ministers has given a mandate to mof to revoke from 10,000 to one million birr.
public offices shall revoke 10,000 birr based on their perogative and 50,000 birr via the consultation of mof.
in a related development mof has disclosed the country’s debt from local and foreign sources, while the report did not include the debt secured by ethiopian airlines and ethio telecom, both are secured loans without a government guaranty.
the government debt has reached usd 28.7 billion. out of this amount, usd 12.7 billion from is from local sources or 47.5 percent and usd 15.99 billion is from external sources.
the government received usd 2.8 billion in non-concessional and concessional loans in the 2018/19 budget year. this is down from usd 3.5 billion in the 2017/18 budget year. haji said the reduction shows the government’s strict procedures on accessing loans.
the country is stressed out from debt because they have recently received a lot of money for some finalized and under construction projects and some of the major loans are commercial loans mainly from china.
regarding joint projects with the private sector the initial bid for dicheto and gaad scaling solar projects the government targeted to develop in a public private partnership (ppp) has opened on august 15.
in the bid 12 companies have been listed out of five that participated, according to haji. the technical evaluation and financial evaluation will be finalized in august 28 and august 30. haji explained the final result would be disclosed in september 2. the projects sites located at afar and somali regions are expected to generate 125mw each and estimated to cost usd 150 million each.
under the ppp the government plans to finish eight solar projects, five hydro power and three road projects."
"a recent study from the addis ababa city administration bureau of labor and social affairs indicates that 92 percent of people who are homeless in addis ababa have come from other regions outside the capital.
most people begging on the street have come from the southern nations, nationalities and people’s region, oromia and amhara regional states. only eight percent of those grew up in addis. there are around 51,000 beggars and street children living in addis. of these 78 percent are between 13 and 45 years of age. in many cases these people end up in prostitution. most street begging occurs in kikos, ledeta, arada and bole sub cities.
according to the city’s draft law, prostitutes, homeless children and beggars cannot ask for money in public places including transport services and parking areas as well as along the streets of addis ababa. a person giving money to beggars will face a 2,000 birr fine.
endashaw abera, social welfare director at the bureau told capital that begging on the city streets is a disease that eats into the fabric of social, economic, religious, political and educational structures.
“we are in trouble, the number of street children is increasing and some able-bodied people who instead of doing some work, undertake to begging as their profession. we are drafting a law to stop it and returning some to their families and for others we will provide jobs,” he said.
“street begging affects not only the geographical and social structure of urban areas; it also portrays the country in a bad light to tourists and foreign visitors. the simplest and most humane way to get rid of beggars is to stop giving them money. as soon as begging is not profitable, they will find something else to do to earn a living. if you have a culture of begging, it means that you also have a culture of giving money to beggars. you must educate the people who are giving the money to organize and find a more constructive way to help,” he said.
some sociologists recommend that the government build the economy and create jobs before banning the beggars from the street. currently the city administration is building a shelter at kality for elders, young girls and women and children who are on the street. so far 250 people have joined the shelter but there is room for more. eight ngos have agreed to work with the city administration to help people transition from begging."
"hawassa industrial park, the country’s flagship industrial park plans to double its workforce from 27,000 to 60,000 next year.
fitsum ketema, general manager of hawassa industrial park told capital that all available 52 factory sheds were transferred to 21 international companies. some are yet to fully embark on their operations amid ongoing machine instillation work.
the government has invested a lot in these parks hoping it would create jobs and bring in foreign currency. although the jobs have come, many pay extremely low wages.
according to a report by the new york stern center for business and human rights despite the garment market’s growth, ethiopian garment factory workers are, on average, the lowest paid in the world. they earn around 26 usd per month, far too little to cover basic needs like housing, shelter and food.
fitsum says the industrial park is designed to create jobs, bring in foreign currency, and transfer technology. fitsum also emphasized the park’s indirect economic benefits to hawassa city and its surroundings.
that is why the government is also improving hawassa’s connectivity with the extension of the addis-adama highway to hawassa, the construction of a domestic airport, and the extension of the addis – modjo – djibouti railway to hawassa.
for the just completed fiscal year, the country was able to export 110 million usd worth of products from the industrial park which is up by 35 percent compared with the previous year, the corporation failed to achieve its target for the budget year due to instability in some parts of the country, according to the industrial park development corporation.
built by china civil engineering construction corporation (ccecc), the hawassa industrial park was completed in a record time of nine months, and inaugurated back in july 2016.
ethiopia wants to be the manufacturing hub of africa by 2025, so they have focused on building industrial parks to increase foreign exchange earnings. it plans to build 30 industrial parks in the near future."
youth organized to demolish houses around the la gare area told the woreda administration that they were unhappy about being sidelined from demolishing the shipping lines and varnero buildings.
"ethiopian airlines ceo tewolde gebremariam says they experienced a revenue growth of 17 percent for a total of usd 3.7 billion.
in a speech to employees, tewolde said net profits had decreased compare to the 6.8 billion birr 2017/18 profit. the crash and subsequent suspension of the 737-800 max due to safety issues cost the airline a lot of money. in addition, engine problems in the boeing 787 led to a shortage of those planes which made ethiopian reduce flights.
tewolde added that instability in the county, a slowing economy and the decline of exports contributed negatively to their revenue. the flagship carrier transported 12.1 million passengers in the reported period, up by 13 percent from the previous fiscal year. there were 110,220 flights 80 percent of which departed on time.
freight grew by 8 percent from previous fiscal year to 400,371 tons.
the airline started six new international destinations including asmara, istanbul, mogadishu, manchester, jakarta and moscow in the stated period.
“the profitability of the airline industry has been up and down. many airlines in asia, europe, and the middle east and almost all african airlines have experienced losses. we are continuing our profitability though it is not like before,’’ tewolde said in a statement he sent to the employees of the airline.
“the 25 percent increase of oil, during a global economic slowdown has also reduced the number of passengers from other african countries. the ebola virus in drc and its exaggerated reports also cost us money,” he added.
the chief executive also announced that his management decided to increase salaries of the employees by 15 percent.
he went on to discuss ethiopian’s vision 2035, which would expand passengers, staff, and destinations. “we delivered the 2025 vision plan except for the revenue seven years ahead of schedule and now we are working on another plan.”
recently, the government decided to sell an undisclosed amount of the airline’s share which has been monopolized by the state.
ethiopian air lines often referred to as simply ethiopian, is ethiopia’s flag carrier and is wholly owned by the government. eal was founded on 21 december 1945 and commenced operations on 8 april 1946, expanding to international flights in 1951."
"commercial bank of ethiopia (cbe) has reversed course and is back in the black. during the 2018/19 fiscal year, the bank’s gross profits were 17.9 billion birr. this is an increase of almost seven billion birr compared with the 2017/18 performance.
according to the bank’s annual report, they had increases of 102.9 percent and 163.6 percent in gross profit, compared with the year’s target and preceding period respectively.
in 2017/18 cbe’s gross profit stood at 10.4 billion birr. this was a reduction of 4.3 billion birr compared with the 2016/17 performance of 14.7 billion birr.
before the 2017/18 financial year the bank’s earnings were rising around 10 percent every year but in the 2017/18 financial year they declined. the ended year performance has a growth almost 65 percent compared with the preceding period.
the devaluation and hard currency revenue is what caused the banks’ earnings to decline.
during the year cbe secured close to usd 4 billion in the just ended financial year from money transfers, while the export of hard currency earning was about only quarter billion usd.
in his report the recently assigned president bacha gina, said that the remittance earnings in the past financial year was usd 3.9 billion, while export earnings were usd 269 million. the bank has also secured usd 2.1 billion in transfers from the national bank of ethiopia, central bank.
early this week bacha said that his bank provided usd 2 billion to the private sector, while in his report on friday he stated that cbe provided usd 1.5 billion to private importers.
according to the report of cbe at the end of last financial year the bank added 145 billion birr as incremental assets and its total assets have now climbed to 712 billion birr. the assets increased by 44 billion birr more than the target.
in the 2018/19 year, cbe has amassed an additional 89.4 billion birr as deposits with a 102pct performance compared with the target and similar percentage compared with the preceding year.
the private deposit mobilization has registered a growth of 134 percent compared with the preceding year and stood at 67.9 billion birr, which is also higher than the target.
the total deposit mobilization of the bank has stood at 541 billion birr and the private sector saving has taken the lion’s share by 368 billion birr.
regarding non performing loan (npl) the bank registered significant improvement and its npl has shrunk to 1.8 percent from 3.5 percent a year ago. for the year cbe, which is also major finance provider for government owned projects, has provided 129 billion birr in loans and advances. of which the private sector secured 22.2 billion birr, which is almost one sixth of the total loan disbursement."
"a recent inspection by the ministry of trade indicates that over half the soap on the market is below standard.
iyasu simon, who directs imports and exports at the ministry told capital that 1044.92 metric tons of soap samples have been studied. they also inspect detergents and soaps being sold at shops. this includes liquid and powder detergents as well as solid soaps. over half of all of these were below the standards.
“most of the soap and detergents products fail to meet the standards”, said the import and export director.
some of the parameters are total fatty content, total active matter and foam testing parameters.
lack of awareness about national standards and misuse, wrong labeling limitation capacity of the testing laboratory are some of the reasons. according to iyasu, using unknown raw materials which are untraceable are the other big challenges.
in ethiopia, there are more than 70 soap and detergent factories and more than 80 percent of them are found in addis ababa.
soap is also produced by small scale manufacturers; there are more than 600 small scale soap manufactures in ethiopia which makes quality regulation difficult.
in ethiopia soap and detergent per capita consumption is less than 2 kg which is less than the average compared to other countries which show the huge gap in demand and supply of the products.
in the production of soap and detergent, 80-90 percent input is water while the main challenge is chemicals imported to use as an ingredient. according to the data from chemical development institute, ethiopia imported over 21 billions of tones of chemicals for the last eight years that cost that country more than six billion birr.
lack of technology transfer, lack of expert in the field, shortage of working capital; supply of raw materials the challenge that local manufacturers raise.
though, ethiopia attempt to earn foreign currency from exportation of soap and detergent by the combined effort of shemu plc, unilever manufacturing p.l.c, bekas chemicals plc, and qingninchen soap factories are able to attract less than 500 thousand usd for the past three years."
"many private banks are not comfortable with the national bank of ethiopia’s (nbe) five percent interest rates on deposits and the requirement that they purchase 27 percent of nbe bills every time they pay out a loan. now they are asking for the requirement to be dropped or interest rates to be raised.
the banks also are giving the option to nbe to use the development bank of ethiopia’s loan service if the nbe lifts its mandate that nbe bills be purchased.
the ethiopian bankers association says interest rates should be two percent higher than they are.
“honestly speaking nbe is changing a lot of regulations quickly, but i hope they see that the deposit amount really needs to be increased,” an association representative said.
private bank representatives say they could handle financial services more efficiently if they were allowed to perform the tasks currently being handled by the development bank of ethiopia.
solomon assefa, vice president of birhan bank said, “dbe’s nonperforming loans (npls) were near 40 percent last year as opposed to three percent for private banks. now our deposits go to dbe but they are having problem with large projects they financed because of defaulted loans. if the government regulates the interest rates for mega projects in manufacturing, agriculture or construction we can provide good service.
economist derje degfew says changing the rule or dissolving dbe may damage the country’s economy.
“private banks are more oriented to profit. if they conduct the work of dbe they may not give priority to financing agriculture or other sectors which the country needs so it is better to have a strict policy.”
in 2011 nbe mandated that all banks except the commercial bank and development bank, both of which are state owned, buy 27 percent of nbe bills for every loan disbursement at a three percent interest rate with a five year maturity period.
banks have claimed that the nbe bills shrink their liquidity and smash their capacity to provide loans for clients. they have also argued that the three percent interest rate goes against the minimum market rate that nbe itself imposed. when the directive, ‘mfa/ nbe bills/001/2011’, became effective the minimum interest rate was five percent it then increased to seven percent when the birr devalued by 15 percent along with other major hard currencies."
"people have been flocking to mekele from other parts of the country and landlords have responded by increasing rental prices as much as 70 percent.
people living in mekele told capital that a 175 square meter plot of land which would have cost 1.5 million birr three years ago now goes for over 3 million birr.
in some locations such as hawleti, 18 kebele, and adi shenhun landlords have increased their rental prices by at least 100 percent. one room that is five by four meters could cost 2,700 birr per month.
residents who were paying 2,000- 3,000 birr for two room for residential housing are now finding landlords demanding 5,000 birr. villa houses are going for 10,000 compared with 7,000 birr previously.
the city which had less than 400,000 people two years ago has seen its population skyrocket to 600,000 thus increasing housing demand.
solomn tadesse a public relations officer at the tigray urban development and trade and industry bureau told capital that the increase is happening as people come to mekele because of instability elsewhere.
“due to the instability in some parts of the country many people who born in tigray are coming to mekele to secure a safe place for them and their family, this has led to an increase in housing prices as a government we have a plan, we are trying to register people for land and housing.”
residents fear housing prices will continue their sharp rise if something isn’t done soon.
a young man who requested anonymity said:
“with the growing population and lack of a proper housing strategy to meet the demand, mekele’s rental market is not a level playing field. the majority of renters struggle to keep up with the pace and spend thousands birr in rent to secure a roof over their heads.”
“as far as we know it is the basic law of economics wherever demand outstrips supply, the price of the commodity including houses rises and this is what happening. we always advise them to settle for what people can afford to pay,” he said.
in the past three years the mekele city administration gave land to over 18,000 people who wanted to build a g+1 house on 74 square meters of land."
"the state owned commercial bank of ethiopia has dropped the grace period those who won the lottery for 40 /60 condos and made a contractual agreement with the bank and housing agency.
in the previous condo transfer at least one year grace periods were given however, for no apparent reason the bank began receiving payments one month after the contract was signed with an interest rate of 9.5 pct.
the price is 6,992 birr per square meter. those buying one bedroom condos must complete payments in 10 years, while those with two or three bedroom condos must pay off the loan in 12 years.
buyers who talked to capital said that cbe should not have made them pay money before they received the house.
abebe tesfaye, who recently won a lottery for a condo said: “the houses are in the finishing stages and we will live in them in a year but cbe doesn’t understand that this means we must rent another house so we end up paying double the cost with the one year grace period we are more capable of paying off our loan,” he said.
capital was unable to get a response from cbe. condo houses cost from 415,328 birr to 692,214 depending on how many rooms are in the house. they measure from 61 to 123sqm.
when the 40/60 condo housing schemes began in 2013, aashde set the price at 2289, 3300 and 3860 birr per square meter for one, two and three bedrooms respectively. however during the last 40/60 condo lottery the agency increased prices by 91,470 birr while 3 and 4 bedroom apartments wend up 110,650 and 124,000 birr respectively.
currently 130,000 condo houses of 20/80 and 40/60 are under construction which began five years ago and it takes a minimum of two years to deliver these house to the beneficiaries. high corruption in condo construction, poor auditing, poor supervision, inefficient contractors are behind the much delayed condo construction. recently the fedral audit bureau ordere an immediate audit work to understand the weakness in the house finance.
in the past 15 years near 200,000 houses were transferred but over one million are still waiting."
"according to the addis ababa city administration bureau of labour and social affairs around half of the capital’s 317 employment agencies are exploiting people through illegal practices.
the bureau’s assessment found 117 agencies posting fake jobs, demanding money from the potential employees, manipulating people into doing excessive work, not paying taxes, and sexually harassing women.
the bureau pointed out that 39,800 jobs posted by the agencies demanded payment from those seeking work, which is illegal. then they would turn around and ask employers to pay the worker’s salary directly to them claiming the pay was commission.
many jobs were fake but still the agencies would take money from those desperately looking for work. the bureau said 20 agencies had their licenses revoked for posting fake jobs.
“fake recruiters are catfishing desperate job-seekers, seducing them with the promise of a high-paying job before stealing their money,” bureau head alemtshay paulos told capital.
according to her many agencies are exploiting people looking for domestic or service industry work.
“fake recruiters are impersonating legitimate people at real companies. when the person contacts you, everything appears real-a real company with a real person’s name and photo that appears in that company’s directory of employees. the agencies charge you hefty fees but later you are informed that the job offer is fake.”
she added that some agencies have been bringing many girls from rural areas, keeping them in small rooms in addis promising that eventually they will send them to arab countries for domestic work.
“we have not started yet to send people abroad for domestic work, we are in the preparation stage but some agencies bring girls and take money from them. they promise that they will soon send them abroad. often they are sexually assaulted or face other abuse.
she urged all stakeholders to stop these crimes by working together and asked that people tell them if they are aware of such illegal agencies.
“workers will be subjected to a mandatory pre-departure training and verification of their contracts of employment before leaving ethiopia. those wishing to engage in recruitment must become familiar with the new requirements and regulations,” she added .
thousands of ethiopian migrant workers are in the middle east as domestic workers, cleaners, drivers, chefs ect. some say recruiting agencies are part of the problem."
"illegal water bottling is a serious challenge according to the general assembly of the recently formed the ethiopian bottled water and soft drinks manufacturing industries association (ebwsdmia).
one of the participants, who attended the meeting at harmony hotel on august 1, stated that the illegal bottlers are creating a huge problem.
the participant said he has seen many illegal bottlers operating on the outskirts of addis ababa. not only are they using below standard plastic packaging, they are also putting not-potable water into the bottles.
“there needs to be a way to ensure that people drinking bottled water are in fact getting pure water,” he said. plastic product producers have to be asked about their activity, where they are getting their supply, and who is behind their products,” he added.
at the meeting other participants agreed that unscrupulous businesspeople are creating an unsafe environment.
recently the association was able to stop the neck sleeve production in bottled waters.the association argued that it is the major reason for illegal activity since users give attention to the neck sleeves to know if the product is genuine or not. if the package is sealed it is more likely to be authentic.
getnet belay, president of ebwsdmia, recently said that it would be difficult for people making bottled water to produce the top packaging, while the neck sleeve can be easily sealed.
neck sleeves have been banned as of july 23. some are still using it though.
the association has also requested the central back to block the letter of credit for the import of neck sleeves.
at the meeting officials of ebwsdmia advised bottlers to investigate their sales and marketing staff that might be working in cahoots with fake water bottlers. recently capital reported that the police are investigating illegal water bottlers."
"brokers, hoarding, loose regulations and reduction in food production are being blamed for a spike in the prices of onions, garlic and wheat.
one kilo of onions, which previously went for 15 birr has doubled to 30 birr and a kilo of garlic has skyrocketed to 180 birr. the slow procurement of wheat also caused the local wheat market to sell it for a quintal at 2,300 birr which was 1,000 up to 1,200 birr a month ago.
a trade expert says another problem is banning heavy trucks from driving in addis during the day as well as instability and low production but brokers are taking advantage of the situation for their own greedy gain.
alemu (name has been changed) a city market inspection employee says ethiopia’s agriculture must be revolutionized. 
“agricultural commodities required for industrial use need to cost less for the products to penetrate not just the domestic market, but also the international market. it is pertinent to state that this is beyond what our aging farming population can provide. so, there is an urgent need for the modern practice of agriculture that requires the efforts of our educated youth.”
“when agriculture is made attractive, youth will go into it and produce food in large quantity, which will reduce the cost of food items. we have good climate and weather,” alemu said.
the addis ababa trade and industry bureau said brokers and hoarders are the main problem.
debre densa, basic commodity distribution expert at the bureau said there must be good market linkage between the producer and the consumers.
“we can’t say that all the consumer products rise with less production, if you look around the country some products are determined by the brokers not the demand and the supply game and as a bureau we are working with cooperative unions to supply the product which helps us to decrease the products in some time but brokers are still challenging us by breaking our chain with cooperative unions,’’ he said."
"ethiopia’s revenue from exports continued to decrease as the country failed to hit its target for the just completed fiscal year. the country earned only 2.67 billion usd.
though the government planned to earn 4.32 billion usd from exports, it achieved only 61 percent of its target.
ministry of trade and industry’s communication director wendimu flate said that the underperformance in meat, dairy products, spices, leather and leather products, cattle, inputs of some chemicals, construction and mining especially gold exports achieved below 50 percent of their target.
agriculture contributed 74 percent of the exported share which is 2.1 billion usd while manufacturing and mining contributed 453.60 and 46.18 million usd in revenue respectively.
“the manufacturing and mining sector’s underperformance really hurt us,” wendimu said.
in terms of export destination by country the usa takes the lead followed by somalia and the netherlands out of the 146 trade partners.
the failure of increasing productivity and reliance of raw agricultural commodities in addition to the contraband border trade across the country and lack of meaningful diversification of export items has been often mentioned as a reason for the poor performance of ethiopia’s export sector.
lack of input for the manufacturing companies, which often couldn’t get hard currency on time and power shortages are reasons for manufacturing’s struggle.
the countries export performance has begun to decrease starting from 2016, where goods with a value of around 3.16 billion usd were exported from ethiopia followed by export performance that registered 2.83 billion usd in 2017.
the ministry plans to earn 4.69 billion usd for this fiscal year. agriculture will still be relied on the most at 3.2 billion usd, which is 70 percent of the total exports."
"the price of locally distilled edible oil has gone up significantly after reports surface that palm oil was linked to health hazards. sources in the local edible oil industry stated that in the past few weeks, prices of the local product have been rising rapidly.
about a month ago the price of local edible oil was about 50 birr per litter, which immediately increased 5 birr when the public health institute announced that imported palm oil has several health related problems, according to sources.
sources said that the price of local oil price has spiked in recent weeks and has reached about 70 birr per liter at producers. the price at the retail market has also reached 100 birr, according to a product distributor, who works for a local oil factory.
the addis ababa city administration trade bureau deputy head mesfin assefa said that price increases are occurring without any economic. he said that they attempted to put a stop to this not only with oil but other household items as well.
“if this does not solve the problem our other option is suspending the actors and prosecuting people,” mesfin told capital.
he said that this week their office has taken against some sales people for increasing prices for no apparent reason.
prices of necessities are rising more quickly in recent times triggering high inflation.
in its market observation capital confirmed that the price of oil has reached 90 birr per litter at the retail market from the previous 65 birr. locally produced oils use ingredients like soybean, niger seeds, cottonseeds, and other products grown here.
since the implementation of the price cap in 2011 the government has imported oil and it now controls the palm oil market via consumers’ associations or shops in the country. the import is being done to manage the price, while the negative effect of the edible oil including the quality of the imported product has created concern for experts.
recently the public health institute, which is the government body, advised stopping palm oil imports due to side effects it then changed the statement to recommend exercising caution."
"the ethiopian bottled water and soft drinks manufacturing industries association (ebwsdmia) based on a recommendation from the ministry of trade and industry (moti) wrote to the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) to recommend that banks suspend approval of the letter of credit (lc) for partial import of input for the bottled water industry.
the association in collaboration with food, beverage, pharmaceutical industries development institute, which is under moti, ethiopian environment and climate change commission, ethiopian standard agency (esa), and food, medicine and health care administration and control authority has been working for the last year including undertaking detailed studies to suspend the use of neck sleeve packaging in the bottled water industry.
the case has been also tabled at the national standardization council, which is responsible for approving the national quality and standardization strategy proposed by the ethiopian standard agency (esa), at the recent meeting followed by the approval of fetlework gebregziabher, minister of moti and chair of the council that comprised members from different ministries and agencies like ministry of health and agriculture.
due to the acceptance of the association in partnership with the stated stakeholders announced that as of tuesday july 23 the water production should halt the use of the neck sleeve, which is mostly imported plastic.
“to realize the decision the association has written a letter to the governor of nbe, the central bank, to order banks to stop issuance of the lc for the import of the input for the water bottlers,” ashenafi merid, general manager of ebwsdmia, told capital.
he said that the letter that copied for moti has asked the central bank to impose on banks to cut the hard currency allocation for neck sleeve.
“moti has also promised that it would support the decision and follow the illegal activity to import the neck sleeve including via contraband route,” ashenafi added.
he said that members came voluntarily to be part of the association due to that they have to respect the decision and suspended the use of neck sleeve as of tuesday.
even though the association and the relevant government bodies stated that the use of neck sleeve should be halted as of july 23 the issue does not get mutual acceptance by manufacturers, according to the sector actors.
“there are three groups on the issue,” an expert in the sector told capital. the expert, who preferred anonymity, said that that the first group expressed its concern that the public might lose its trust in the bottled water that is not sleeved by the plastic paper on the neck. “it has become a custom on the market due to that some bottlers are not interested to halt the production without neck sleeve,” he added.
according to the expert, the second group is that it has massive stock on its center and demands the decision to postpone for another period, while the third group is who supports the current decision.
experts on the sector argued that the new decision would not have enforcement or penalty if it is by passed by any manufacturers.
“we wrote the letter for nbe due to it is one of the ways to control barring the use of neck sleeve, and moti has also promised that it would control the import of the product,” ashenafi argued.
he said that the association is formed under mutual interest and the current move is also the interest of the sector, while the full applicability might takes time.
“currently the association is developing a code of conduct that will govern the members and the sector. the code of conduct is also consider the full implementation of refusing to use of neck sleeve on the production,”
“refusing neck sleeve packaging has all benefit than side effect on the market,” getnet belay (eng), president of ebwsdmia, said.
traditionally local manufacturers use the neck sleeve that becomes a trend for every bottlers that are currently reached at 85. getnet said that the using neck sleeve has made the sector vulnerable for forged producers, while refusing the use of it same production time and cost.
ashenafi said that for instance factories whose machine for the sealing damaged should wait for days until it is maintained and sometimes the product import might be delayed, which also forced bottlers to cut their production.
they also claimed that it is pro environment. “the neck sleeve is very small and is difficult for collection and recycling,” the president said.
recently solomon tadele, director general of food, beverage and pharmaceutical industry development institute told capital that neck sleeves packaging is not common in other countries and it is not mandatory on ethiopia’s standardization rule.
tradition pioneer water bottlers started the neck sleeves packaging followed by the late comers, but it could not be a measurement for standard or quality.
some other bottlers like soft drink and juice manufacturers in ethiopia are not using neck sleeve.
solomon said that such kind of packaging is costing the factories by importing machines for the specific packaging, additional labour cost for the operation besides importing unnecessary raw material.
based on their capacity water bottlers are allocated from usd 40,000 to usd 50,000 to import neck sleeve, which is huge sum in total, but it would be stopped as per the claim of the association."
"the ministry of cultural and tourism reports that 84,000 fewer people visited ethiopia for business or tourism in 2018.
in 2017 a total of 943,343 visitors came to ethiopia while in 2018 849,000 tourists visited. ethiopia’s goal was to bring in 2.7 billion usd from tourism although it’s unclear if this happened.
the political instability of the country and the weak promotion of tourism are behind the slump in tourism. those visiting friends and relatives declined in 2018 from 325,844 the year before to 61,681. conference attendees increased from 16,909 the year before to 62,077. those coming for leisure amounted to 316,000, which is a decrease of 132,000 the year before. those on transit visas numbered 120,000 an increase from 47,685 in 2017.
in 2018 africans from djibouti, eretria ,kenya, malawi, rwanda, somalia, tanzania, uganda, zimbabwe, chad ,sudan south africa, ghana, mali and nigeria shared 29.35 of the total visitors while the north american countries; usa and canada shared 19.88 percent. 
globally the highest number of tourists come from the usa at 147,000, china and uk had 50,626 and 42,725 visitors respectively.
among people coming from african countries to ethiopia, nigeria was in first place with 27, 422 visitors while kenya and south africa have 23,380 and 17, 145 respectively.
ethiopia’s tourism has suffered the effect of anti-government protests and violence in the past four years. under prime minister abiy ahmed, ethiopia in 2018 started a visa-free entry plus issuance of e-visas have been identified as key boosters to the sector in the coming years.
most of the tourists ethiopia attracts are from africa, followed by europe and north america. tourism accounts for 4.1 percent of ethiopia’s gdp and is expected to increase to five percent by 2026. the tourism industry in ethiopia could be legitimately described as one that is still in its infancy. its current low level of development is often attributed to weak promotion, lack of trained manpower, finance, and knowledge and management capacity.

"statements from the executive bodies of the amhara democratic party (adp) and tigray people’s liberation front (tplf) clearly shows they are not interested in working together like they did for the past 27 years.
like rivals both insulted, criticized and undermined each other in statements that brought about negative responses from many academicians and political groups.
tplf’s statement heavily criticizing adp said the party failed to secure regional peace and security. it went on to say that they hosted parasite groups working to destabilize the nation.
the statement listed seven points asking eprdf to allow independent investigators to look into the groups behind the assassination of the late commander in chief of the army general seare mekonen and his friend.
the statement also asked adp to apologize to the ethiopian people for creating a lax security environment which failed to protect the adp leaders, ambachew mekonen and ezez wasse, and migbaru kebede.
tplf also asked eprdf what the schedule and plan is for next year election.
tplf slammed eprdf for failing the nation’s security.
“working with the groups who are devoted to federalism is the number one priority of the party and the party will fully collaborate in bringing peace,’’ the tplf statement reads.
tplf also said that the sidama people’s request for the establishment of their own state should be handled rightly in accordance with the constitution.
adp responded strongly to the tplf statement saying “tplf is the one who caused the country to have a nasty political situation.”
“tplf is the one that bit the country and put us in trouble and it is the one who barked as if it was pure behind every problem. if the party was standing for justice it would have extradited the criminals who hide in tigray, who are alleged of committing crimes against the ethiopian people. but instead it is collaborating with the groups who are working to disturb the county and the region,” reads the adp statement.
professor merera gudina leader of the oromo federalist congress told capital that both parties bitter rivalry is the result of different views of reform and old hidden attitude not cooperating to work toward common goals.
“it is not surprising. because it was in their mind and what happens now. they both rule the nation and should bring a solution before undermining each other not give us bread instead it will get us into trouble. eprdf as a party should bring other parties who work for good democracy and must make a national consensus to give a better light to our country.”
benyam g/hanna, a political science graduate from addis ababa university says the dispute between adp and tplf is the result of conspiracy theories in the eprdf house.
“we don’t know the real game in the country, there are games being played in the ruling party which are filled by a hidden agenda and this has cost us lives. one group is trying to hold the full power and public acceptance by making conspiracies and if the party does not come with a genuine agreement our country will be submerged into great chaos and disorder.’’
professor beyene petros, ethiopia social-democratic party (esdp) chairman sees both party statements as childish. they do not address the country’s real problems.
“if there is a problem among parties they must sit and come with a solution but they are not doing that. instead, they are giving statements which undermine the ethiopian people. what is needed is a solution, what we need is someone who to give us hope and stopping us from getting in trouble,’’ he said.
kinfemicheal debebe (abebe kesto) who was member of the ethiopian democratic party and the unity for democracy and justice (udjp) and was released from prison last year said that tplf can’t blame adp for the murder of the amhara region’s leaders.
“security is a huge issue. decades ago kinfe g/medhin was assassinated and adp did not blame tplf, when haylom araya was killed adp did not say tplf was getting the country into trouble. what tplf said is a very bizarre opinion to me. any how’s the real thing that eprdf should do now is looking inside itself not wasting time on undermining one another which bring us nothing for us,’’ he added ."
"on monday july 8 the addis ababa city administration banned heavy trucks from driving through the city between 6:30 am and 8pm to speed up traffic flow. now exporters using air cargo are saying they should be exempt.
the change has been visible as traffic jams have improved significantly during rush hour.
tewodros zewdie, executive director of the ethiopian horticulture producer exporters association (ehpea), said that even though the decision has made a dent in traffic snarls, other side effects were not taken into consideration. according to tewodros, ethiopian flowers are exported via airfreight on both passenger and cargo flights.
“the flight schedules vary and our members need to be able to transport their products any time to bole international airport, which is the main hub for ethiopian cargo mainly for flowers and meat export,” the executive director told capital.
but based on the new directive issued by the addis ababa cabinet,trucks that transport the perishable products to the airport are forced to stop their movement and fined, according to information that capital obtained.
“we appreciate the directive but there should be several schemes like allowing movement of perishable export products, since the flight schedule is on a different timeframe and arranged by airlines,” tewodros said.
people in the horticulture sector complained that the current problem affects the quality of their products which might force them to discard the flowers. tewodros acknowledge that the association does not have any quantitative evidence so far about the effect of the new rule on their business.
“so far we do not have latest analysis but definitely the current situation will affect the quality of our members’ product,” he explained.
he said that in the past couple of days he has talked about the issue with relevant government bodies like the addis ababa city transport programs management office, who controls the scheme. this morning i was talking with people in the government about how best to move our products,” he told capital on friday july 12.he mentioned that city officials told him the city cabinet may make some changes.
kenya and ethiopia are the top flower exporters on the african continent.
meat exporters said that they are also being affected. abattoirs are complaining that their products have been stranded. they claimed that the quality of the product, which is sensitive, will be affected by any interruption.
semere jelalu, traffic safety and management deputy head at addis ababa city transport programs management office, told capital that trucks can pay a fee to operate in the city.
in the day time to move in the city from 10 am to 4 pm trucks must pay 500 birr per day, while on peak hours in the morning and evening they have to pay 1,000 birr per day, according to semere.
the new rules allow medium trucks like vehicles that have a capacity of 3.5 tons to move from 10 am to 4 pm freely.
“since the beginning of the new scheme we did not stop any trucks of the stated sectors but if they did not pay and take the document that allows their movement they might be penalized by traffic police,” he said.
“the aim of the fee is to discourage them from driving during the day and rush hour and to re-arrange their schedule,” he added.
but he said that exporters are complaining about the fee.
“the directive is issued by the city administration that is also responsible to amend the directive in favor of such sectors,” traffic safety and management deputy head at addis ababa city transport programs management office explained.
capital tried to talk with wondemu felate, public relations head at ministry of trade and industry about the issue but was not successful."
"ethiopia has seen the volume and income from its exports decrease. now the country is also experiencing contractual agreements being breached between exporters and those purchasing contracts from abroad. the ministry of trade and industry reported 24 contracts in default last fiscal year. some exporters claim that figure could actually be around 100 if the matter was studied more closely.
most of the defaulted contracts involve cattle, pulses and sesame seeds and a majority of those on the receiving end are located in saudi arabia, india and dubai.
there are 13 ethiopian exporters who did not send agricultural products to places like egypt, israel, oman, india, singapore and saudi arabia as they promised.
exporters say importers, import agents and bankers have defaulted, renegotiated, confirmed orders or even cancelled shipments and letters of credit or contracts without reason.
prices have risen as a result of instability and scraping high-value currency notes which disrupts trading in the cash-oriented market.
out of concern the ministry is preparing a regulation about the issue. haimanot tibebu, export, research and promotion director at the ministry told capital that the draft regulation will decrease defaults.
“the problem is that some exporters are reluctant to fulfil agreements with receivers in destination countries. some rely on the advance payments from the receivers but the receivers don’t want to pay until they get the product.” she went on to say that these defaults undermine ethiopia’s credibility in the world and that the regulation is needed.
one exporter who did not give their name said contractual defaults occur primarily because of the high prices at the ethiopia commodity exchange (ecx).
“exporters are buying at high prices set everyday at ecx, they often lose money but compensate for this by importing other products with the hard currency they get from exporting. then others are forced to breach the contracts they made with importers abroad because they can’t make profits on ecx prices. so the best solution is to drop the ecx transaction and to set the price based on buyer and supplier demand.”
in the past six months ethiopia’s export revenue was 1.21 billion usd which was 750 million usd short of the government’s goal of usd 1.96 billion. current challenges to ethiopia’s exports come from instability, failure to increase productivity, reliance on raw agricultural commodities, contraband border trade and lack of meaningful diversification of export items in addition to lack of inputs for manufacturing companies due to the shortage of hard currency. ethiopia’s major exports include coffee, oil seeds such as sesame, flower, khat, fruits, vegetables, minerals and some manufactured goods. ethiopia’s forex consuming import products include fuel, machines, medicines, steel, manufactured goods, foods and simple products such as, toothpicks, candies and cookies."
"japan tobacco international explained at the economist’s illicit trade summit held a week ago in addis at hyatt regency hotel that 40 percent of the tobacco sold in ethiopia is illegal.
as the trade in illegal cigarettes has mushroomed in recent years with sophisticated distribution networks across all the provinces of ethiopia, the sales of legal, regulated and taxed cigarettes have dropped continuously.
fady rahme, corporate development vice president for middle east, africa and world wide duty free for japan tobacco international explained that illegal trade in tobacco products has a negative impact.
“it is an enormous problem of a global scope, in ethiopia, 40% of the total tobacco market is illegal. not only does illegal tobacco rob the government of tax revenues, it is also linked to much larger organized crimes such as corruption, the trafficking of weapons, narcotics and people, and terrorists,” he said.
“illegal trade can only be curbed if governments and industry work together. tobacco control and fiscal measures should be proportionate so they do not undermine the fight against illegal tobacco.’’
debele kebat, commissioner of the ethiopian customs commission said “the large part of the ethiopian border encompasses extensive lowland areas which cannot be controlled by customs and the federal police. as a result, smugglers can easily access and cross the border with a substantial amount of smuggled goods. millions of birr worth illegal goods enter and leave the country annually via our borders.’’
“so all stakeholders such as law enforcement bodies and regional organizations, international organizations should help us to combat illicit tobacco trading,’’ he added.
over the past five years, the annual turnover of the nte has continually increased by an average of 190 million birr. it offers five brands: nyala, gissila, elleni, delight and nyala premium. the company currently employs close to 1,000 workers.
about 10 percent of the global tobacco market involves illicit trade. the reality, though, is that illicit tobacco trade occurs even more in countries where tobacco prices are low compared to those where prices are high. experts argue tobacco smuggling is not so much due to high cigarette taxes and prices as it is due to the existence of organized criminals, poor control of smuggling, weak enforcement of anti-smuggling laws, and corruption."
"around 70,000 business licenses are being investigated throughout addis ababa by the city’s trade bureau. the month long investigation has focused on service providers, manufacturing companies, drug stores, restaurants, retail shops, importers and exporters. in two weeks a report will be filed with the results of the investigation. ten investigators looked at documents, competency, certificates and the type of business.
“some companies introduce seductive offers, promising high earnings and get rich quick schemes. these claims are backed by forged documents and license certificates. people using these methods will have their licenses revoked. government workers behind allowing illegal business will also be punished,” kasshaun beyene, who directs trade relations, said.
in many cases, these companies are fictitious entities, kasshaun said, carrying out financial fraud, and reaching clients through telephone calls, text messages, e-mails, and social media.
“our main goal is not to stop businesses, it is to let them operate legally. we have over 230,000 businesses operating in the city. we are looking at this sample size to determine the amount of fraud and to see if we need to add more investigators and open more cases. businesses must have a trade license from the bureau to be legitimate.”
the 686/2014 proclamation requires businesses to re-register every year, within the first four months of the fiscal year, which begins on july 7. failure to do so will lead to the expiration of the registration certificate.
however, businesses can renew their licenses all year long, albeit with penalties and the suspension of the license, after the first four months. the first two months after the deadline, businesses do not pay fines for renewals, although their licenses are suspended until they reregister. in the third month, there is fine of 2,500 birr and 1,500 birr for each subsequent month, until the end of the fiscal year. after this licenses are canceled.
business license renewal, on the other hand, requires tax clearance and quality certification from the appropriate authority. moreover, licenses cannot be renewed without a valid business registration certificate."
"the addis ababa light rail transit (aalrt) plans to implement a uniform ticket price in august which the corporation believes will minimize mischief’s made by passengers.
manager of aalrt, muluken assefa said that the controllers seize many passengers who pays nothing or pays the minimum fee to travel the whole route. the corporation also said that it collected over 800, 000 birr from penalties from those who by pass the law on the train.
the penalties range from 30 birr for paying the least ticket to travel long distance while 100 birr for traveling without having ticket.
the managers are now contemplating to start a flat fare payment system for a journey instead of different rates that was calculated on the distance.
the corporation will now make adjustment on ticket prices which will make the fee uniform for all distance.
currently, addis ababa light rail transit has 41 trams in its system. but only 34 of them are under operation while the remaining seven are out of service.
according to the manager, the difficulty of maintaining the trams locally hinders to make operational the entire tram on the track that have created burden on the quality of service delivery.
luck of full fledged maintenance center forced the corporation to send few of the trams abroad for maintenance.
according to the ministry of transport, addis ababa lrt is currently transporting at least 120,000 people per day and over 29 million commuters transported over the past nine months in which the corporation collected about 87.2 million birr revenue from the service.
but the total revenue collected from the daily passengers remains insufficient to sustain its activities as well as maintenance related works.
muluken said on the problems related to repairing the trams and other challenges are hiking the cost of managing the lrt and requested the government to find a way to subsidize addis ababa’s light railways.
the addis ababa light railway was built by the china railway engineering corporation (crec) at a cost of usd 475 million, which 85 percent was covered by china’s export-import bank."
"delivering tap water is the task of the city’s water and sewerage authority. because of the inability to meet resident’s demand for portable water; the authority has begun rationing and delivers water by tankers to the mountainous part of the city. however, individuals and business institutions are forced to buy water from vendors and water tank truck owners even though distributing water is the sole right of the authority. this may incur the business owners and the authority personnel to vandalism by disrupting the rationing schedule.
the capital city addis ababa still has a long way to go when it comes to delivering potable water. the city water and sewerage authority can only able to deliver below 75 percent of water demand for the estimated 5 million inhabitants in which most of them get through rationing.
the 132-year-old capital city, is only able to cover two-thirds of demand by supplying 575,000 cubic meters of portable water to its inhabitants on a daily basis.
most residents of addis ababa are forced to walk far, up to 2km, to fetch water by themselves or they are charged more money by people, like mentesnot kassa to bring it to them. he carries yellow jerry cans that can be filled with 20 liters of water on his shoulders.
for mentesnot, a shoe shine around ferensay legasion, the situation creates additional income for him. he charges customers 15 to 25 birr for a single jerry can depending on the distance traveled to deliver.
business has been thriving since he began the task, so he bought a hand push cart with 5 thousand birr to deliver water to customers.
“the hand push cart helped me to deliver more water and save time in addition to increasing my income,” said mentesnot. residents and eateries are his biggest customers.
birhanu teklu, a public servant in his late 40’s lives in yeka sub city. birhanu who lives with his two children and wife in a rented house is one of his customers.
“i have been living in that area since i came to addis ababa some 11 years ago and water scarcity is a common phenomenon here,” he said.
“there are multiple problems raising two children, the ever increasing school fees, a price hikes in food items, etc. above all the water scarcity is a big challenge,” he adds.
the problem with the water shortage is not only the cost it incurs. it is often unsanitary and not suitable for drinking or cooking because it is contaminated. therefore, we buy bottled water for drinking, he said.
such cases are common in yeka, gulele, and kolfe keraneo sub cities.
to combat the water shortage, the authority will deliver water by tanker trucks to inhabitants via micro enterprises in the mountainous part of addis ababa.
the addis ababa water and sewerage authority mentions several reasons for the shortage of potable water, the ever increasing demand of water, lack of appropriate maintenance, and shortage of hard currency to purchase spare parts, water pipe breakage due to ongoing road construction and the aging of pipes.
the authority mentions frequent power outages as another problem because it has deep wells that needs to be pumped. there are over 150 ground water wells in addition to the main sources of potable water in legedadi, gefersa and akaki.
in the unreliable rationing schedule, some of the areas in addis get water only once or twice a week.
“inhabitants might not get water more than once a week if electric power shortage occurs at the sub-pumping stations,” said nigues desalegne, communication officer at the authority.
the city administration’s inability to meet the demand for clean water has opened business opportunities for water vendors and for those businesses who deliver water through tanker trucks. still others are delivering tap water through tanker trucks to hotels, hospitals and construction sites.
they deliver tap water by tanker truck and charge them up to 1,000birr even though selling water by any means is illegal.
they are arguing that they are charging for transportation and service delivery.
we are not aware of these issues, said nigues, however the authority should focus on working to meet the demand of the city residents, mentioning the ayata fenta water well project with the capacity of producing 68,000 cubic meters a day, legedadi phase 2 water well supply project is expected to generate 86,000 cubic meters of water a day and the gerbi water project with 73,000 cubic meters generating capacity a day as efforts in pipe line to produce additional water supply."
"city bakeries closed for lowering bread weightsa city wide crackdown on rule breaking bakeries benefiting from government subsidized flour has shut the door on 120 bakeries in the last month.
most of these bakeries are located in addis ketema, gullele, arada and kirkos sub cities. the addis ababa trade bureau says the closed bakeries purchased wheat flour for 796 birr per quintal and resold the flour for up to 1,800 birr. then they turn around and make bread with less flour so that customers who think they are paying for 100 grams of bread for 1.30 birr actually were buying as little as 60 grams of bread for that price.
bread pieces that were 200 and 300 grams were also intentionally reduced up to 80 grams during the baking process.
currently over 1,500 bakeries get flour subsidies in addis ababa thorough 44 wheat flour companies working on the outskirts of addis ababa.
kashaun abera, trade inspection head at the bureau told capital that lowering weight is unacceptable.
“bread is one of the basic consumer needs for our meals. the government understands this and has been subsidizing wheat to help the consumer. now some bakeries are lowering bread weights and selling the extra flour instead of using it for bread. this is completely wrong and we will close these bakeries down.”
bakeries owners argue that the government should revise the price of bread instead of rushing to shut down the bakeries.
an anonymous bakery owner said “i just need to tell you that we are being pressured by costs since bakeries are in the middle of the value chain. all the costs are going up, from raw materials we use, spare parts and everything they are going up.”
“this is because we have not been able to cope with the current economic reality. you cannot just raise your price to make a profit because consumers are not ready to accept that. if you produce at the best quality, you cannot make any profit. you have to lower the quality, that is, if at all, your consumers will accept the product,” the owner said.
bakeries are getting 120,929 quintals of flour from the 44 wheat flour factories every month.
the government sells the wheat to flour companies at 500 birr per quintal and flour companies sell the flour to the bakeries at 796.25 birr per quintal."
"the government’s order to prioritize fertilizer over wheat, when being transported from the port of djibouti to ethiopia has meant increased demurrage costs for wheat cargo and delay in getting wheat to the local market.
the ethiopia trading business corporation (etbc) is responsible for distributing the wheat being imported to stabilize the market and supplied to basic institutions like higher educational facilities. however, in the past few weeks the government has given priority to importing fertilizer to be distributed to farmers before the coming rainy season which begins in june.
sources say a huge amount of wheat has been stored at the port in djibouti called doraleh multipurpose port (dmp). currently the wheat transported to the centre is about 20 percent of what was expected, according to sources.
sources affiliated with promising international, one of the major wheat suppliers for the government, told capital that at least 2,700 tons of wheat should be transported every day but the current status is very low.
the sources claimed that lack of coordination in the procurement process has created disorder on the transportation of the country cargo from the port to the centre.
“due to the delay at the port, which is a very hot area, the wheat may face infestation at the warehouse so this will need to be disinfected which will cost more. then there are additional charges for demurrage and scarcity in the local market,” sources said.
in late april the federal transport authority in a letter signed by abdissa yadeta, director general of the authority, indicated that transporting companies should fully focus on the transportation of fertilizer before the rainy season comes.
the corporation’s acting head tariku berasu has also asked the ministry of transport, to use some of the trucks to carry out the transportation of wheat.
tariku told capital that they have agreed with the ministry that some of the trucks should transport wheat. “currently wheat is being transported from the port but it is not as much as we want,” he said. he added that the issue is not only related with fertilizer and wheat but sugar as well. that cargo is being transported in a similar manner into the country.
he said that the corporation faces extra charges due to the demurrage but he does not have further information of insect infestation.
on wednesday may 22 promising wrote a letter to the corporation indicating any damage would be handled by the corporation. “there have been many letters sent to you on a daily basis raising concerns about slow truck deployment from your side and warning about the possibility that infestation may develop, i regret to admit that advice has not been taken into consideration by etbc and today we have been informed that living insects have been found at the warehouse leading to the freeze of cargo uplift,” the letter stated.
“since our contract is governed by cost and freight all liability has been passed to etbc after goods passed the ship’s rail in discharging the port,” it added.
experts said that lack of coordination or some sort of sabotage that the government is unaware of may be the reason for the current incident.
“some sort of liability has to be put on those engaged in the procurement process. they apparently did not learn a lesson from last year’s incidents,” sources told capital.
“the case is directly related with politics since wheat is distributed for daily consumption via bread factories’ millers. if the product is delayed at the port, local market will be affected by shortage,” a source said.
tariku said that the case may be directly related with lack of planning and coordination of assigning transporters or buying some of the products early.
tariku further said that currently the corporation is supplying the full quota to institutions and some wheat to other consumers."
"the black market versus the bank rate margin is now over 42%more and more foreign companies are now using the black market causing the price of foreign currency to rise even higher and the difference between the legal exchange rate at banks and the black market to be over 42 percent. according to sources the rate changes every day on the black market. the current estimation is close to 40 birr per usd while it is about 28 birr at banks. one british pound is 50 birr and one euro is 45 birr.
in the past year for some time illegal foreign currency market rates went down closer to bank prices. over the last few months they resembled a roller coaster but during the last couple of weeks they have skyrocketed again and now are much more different than the legal market. sources say that this is happening because there are many foreign companies investing in ethiopia but not registered at the international level, attempting to obtain foreign currency.
these people said that at present, foreign industries investing in ethiopia are dominant players in the black market. they often are producing just as much as local investors but have better access to hard currency through the suppliers’ credit scheme to import inputs than similar but locally owned businesses.
experts explained that currently foreign companies are able to manage huge liquidity since their business is the dominant player in terms of production throughout the year and they have a lower production cost than those who get a smaller portion of lc for their businesses.
“this allows foreign companies to amass a huge liquidity,” an expert who follows the industry sector explained.
experts said that these investors should wait a long period to wire their foreign currency via banks to their home country since the country is in hard currency crunch.
“the growing liquidity by getting special access to foreign currency for their production and at the same time the shortage of hard currency to transfer their revenue to their home country has pressured investors mainly coming from asian countries to be major players in the black market,” experts that worked with foreign investors explained.
they said that sometimes the investor collects the foreign currency locally but mainly focuses on the remittances sent by diaspora for family here.
the long waiting at banks to transfer their money to home countries pushes foreign investors to become a major player in the illegal currency market, a sales person working with foreign company told capital. “they are collecting the foreign currency illegally here,” he added. he expressed his speculation that the current increase in the rate of the parallel market may be related with this new and growing demand.
experts said that the suppliers’ credit scheme has created a vicious circle effect on the market. “initially foreign companies secured hard currency through the scheme. however, other local investors and at the same time the extraordinary surplus reacting to the imbalance of lc disbursement has increased profit of foreign companies and liquidity pushing them to get foreign currency as soon as possible to wire to their home country,” experts explained.
currently the government via the ministry of revenue and security apparatuses is trying its best to stop illegal foreign currency flow out of the country. it has seized a significant amount of foreign currency from smugglers including foreigners mainly those coming from asia. experts stated that it would be difficult to fully control the illegal remittance system, which requires the involvement of third party or country."
"the ethiopian pharmaceuticals supply agency (epsa), an institution providing pharmaceuticals, laboratory reagents, medical equipment and supplies is saying banking procedures are delaying getting medicine to public.
officials of epsa said this while presenting their nine month performance report to the parliament in mid week.
epsa has blamed the commercial bank of ethiopia’s procedures for over 300 containers of medicine and medical equipment languishing at modjo dry port. the agency opened a letter of credit (lc) at the commercial bank of ethiopia months ahead to ease the process of procurement and deliver the medicines on time.
according to goitom gigar, deputy director of the pharmaceuticals fund and supply agency, the containers have stayed for months at modjo dry port which has an impact on the shelf time of the medicine. they are asking cbe to provide the service with copies.
the time taken at the dry port incurs extra cost, like demurrage expenses in which the agency is obliged to add on the medicines’ cost, goitom said.
the agency said the bank is not processing payments on time to suppliers of the drug, leaving the medicines and medical equipment at the dry port to stay a long time which sometimes creates shortage of medicines.
epsa officials urge law makers to push government officials to create an effective system, which will avail payment of documents to the agency’s medicine and medical equipment suppliers on time.
“we need the bank to release the money budgeted for medicine procurement at the right time and free the containers,” he said, adding, it is due to the inconvenience, that “we face medicine shortages at times”.
“although the agency has a formal agreement with cbe to avail a specified amount of money in a specific period, the bank is not providing the documents showing the release of that money on time,” said goitom.
in addition to cbe’s bureaucratic producers, the agency is paying demurrage costs for the containers holding medicines, which, he said, is not the case in other countries.
according to the officials of the agency, the supply rate of pharmaceuticals has risen from 72 percent to 95 percent in 12 hospitals in addis chosen for the program. and epsa has imported medicines and medical equipment worth 10 billon birr in this fiscal year.
according to the officials, the agency is working hard to meet the demand of medicines throughout the country and confirm the availabilities of all medicines in the country."
"does money go to teachers or owners?according to an assessment by the addis ababa education bureau, private schools in addis ababa have increased next year’s tuition fees from 1,500 to 5,000 birr for a year. this means that overall school prices will rise to between 2,000and 80,000 birr for a year.
according to capital’s assessment most of the schools charge from 1,000 to 12,000 birr for their registration fee.
the schools say they are increasing their prices in response to price hikes in teacher salaries, rental fees and school materials. this year’s increase is not as high as last year’s when prices were raised an average of 5 to 12 thousand birr per year. 
tekabe woldegebriel, vice manager of school of tomorrow told capital that responding to the inflation rate and benefiting teachers are the most crucial factors when it comes to tuition fees.
“housing and food prices are always rising and teachers are suffering because they are unable to meet their basic needs in this hard economy so the school administration has to provide extra money for the teachers.”
“teachers are producing the future who will address the economic, political and social situation of ethiopia. so people working for this deserve support in obtaining cheaper housing.”
a parent who has two children at a private school around bole and wanted to be anonymous said that the price hike at schools is exaggerated and most of the money goes to the owner and not the teacher.
“most of the children’s parents are hired workers and don’t have any means to get an extra income unless they get a salary raise. anybody can witness that in the last few years the country’s economy has slowed down. this means parents are not getting a better income but they told them to increase fee up to 5,000 birr per year which is unacceptable.
“i know some of the schools which have 3,000 students will get extra six million birr income from the increase and i am sure that this schools will not spend one million birr for teacher’s salary. there is little or nothing that the educational bureau can do to check these schools as they are not under their supervision. the right solution is building public schools that can compete with private schools and in this way we can get a fair price from the private schools who currently charge any fee as they wish any time.”
a teacher working in a private school around megenagna said that mentioning teacher’s salary in the school fee increase is just a pretext and most of the increase goes to the owner of the school who manages nothing more than possessing the school.
“schools in the city generally increase salaries around 500 birr annually but they get millions from raising tuition fees. the low pay leads to high staff turnover in the schools.
fikerter abera, deputy director of education relevance and quality assurance at addis ababa education bureau said that parents are complaining about the new prices so the bureau is investigating if the new charges are fair.
currently 1,000, kg, 589 primary and 149 private high schools operate in the city."
"the government is to pay over 200 million birr to cooperative unions as compensation for the non essential purchase of over 271 quintals of fertilizers used as inputs for blending plants.
back in 2015, what was known as the ministry of agriculture (moa) and the agricultural transformation agency (ata), together with four cooperative unions located in four regional states constructed four fertilizer blending factories to supply specific fertilizer mix based on their soil type for specific areas.
“the blending factories are meant to increase the production and productivity of the farmers in the country through the supply of appropriate fertilizer to the soils,” said ousman surur director of the federal cooperative agency.
the ministry and the ata found out that sulfur, potassium, boron and zinc nutrients are deficient in many areas which indicated that one compound fertilizer nps and five blended fertilizers namely npsb, npksb, npsznb, npksznb, and npszn are needed to address the key nutrient deficiencies in the tested soils according to ata’s 2013/14 report.
according to the3 agency, gibe dedessa and becho weliso farmers’ cooperative union in oromia regional states registered success at least in small scale for the first batch of production.
the cooperative union encountered failure when the ministry of agriculture and agricultural transformation agency (ata) purchased non-essential fertilizers of boron, zinc and potash amounting to 271,680 quintals of fertilizer.
“the blending factory quit producing as the result of unspecified fertilizers purchased as an input,” he adds.
as a result the five cooperative unions merkeb cooperative union in amhara region, enderta multipurpose farmers’ cooperative union in tigray region and melek silte in southern nations, nationalities & peoples region (snnpr), gibe dedessa and becho weliso farmers’ cooperative union in oromia region have lost a total of over 200 hundred million birr for administrative expenses, rent for warehouses, bank interest and damage to the plant.
according to the agency, the government is to pay nearly 252.7 million birr to the cooperatives based on the report of auditor general.
the country, which has been using only di-ammonium phosphate (dap) and urea for many years, abandoned dap and began importing a new fertilizer called nps.
the blending factories that were administered under the respective unions were built with a 1.2 million usd grant from the usaid feed the future innovation and were intended to distribute their products to the farmers in their mandated areas through the cooperatives.
presently, over 95 percent of the country’s agricultural inputs including fertilizers are distributed through cooperatives.
cooperatives in ethiopia are play an active role in the fields of finance, input and output marketing, consumer goods, agro processing, mechanization and many other economic and social activities.
currently there are 85,496 primary cooperatives with individual membership 19,502,786 and 388 cooperative unions (secondary tier) with members of 15, 813 primary cooperatives, 3 cooperative federations (tertiary tier) with 146 members. their capital has reached 22.9 billion birr and they employ 1,495,391 people in the country."
"the addis ababa water and sewerage authority disclosed that one of the waste treatment plants at kality is under stress from improper use and illegal activities.
the kality liquid waste disposal site which has a capacity of refining 100,000 cubic meters a day is currently under pressure. they are working at 40 percent of capacity due to illegally connected sewer lines coming from individuals and businesses attempting to dispose of their solid waste and burned oil. this is negatively affecting plants being introduced to refine oil by using biological technology called membrane bio reactor (mbr), a containerized system that refines waste electromagnetically. 
“we have been taking action to stop this, however, the problem persists we need more help,” tesfalem bayu, vice general manager of the authority said.
the system is well advanced and 100 percent effective in purifying, making the end product free from bacteria, and ready for reuse. it also doesn’t stink and can be used for irrigation.
the awareness of the public has also hindered the process by connecting rain water to the lines which create over flow in the site.
“the authority is concerned that the site may encounter more damage as the rainy season comes unless a collective effort is made, he adds.
the authority has started to check over 250 km of previously constructed lines built through help by the world bank.
the kality liquid waste treatment project was made by canadian, belgian and greece contractors to serve over 1 .5 million inhabitants in the city’s sewerage disposal coverage.
the world bank supports modernizing the city’s sewage system with 100 million usd.
according to some studies, the capital addis ababa generates an estimated annual volume of 49mm3 in total wastewater from which about 4mm3 is industrial wastewater addis ababa water & sewerage authority (awssa) is constructing liquid waste treatment plants at koye fectche condominium site. it is 33 thousand cubic meters.
presently, the authority has constructed liquid waste disposal sites at 12 condominium sites which have a capacity of treating 27 thousand metric cubes a day."
"although, ethiopia considers mining to be one of its main foreign currency earnings, the revenue from mineral exports drastically fell for the last nine months of this fiscal year, reports the third mining council after a meeting held in addis ababa last tuesday.
according to samuel urquato, minister of mines and petroleum, the country earned only 39.6 million usd against the projected 766.9 million usd in the stated period.
only 8.85 percent of the target was attained by the ministry, according to kiros alemayehu communication officer at the ministry.
the revenue declined by 78.5 million usd compared to the same period last fiscal year.
according to the ministry, various reforms are under taken to fix the huge mismatch and maximize the revenue from the sector and pointed out that ethiopia is in the final stages of reforming the mining sector to shore up its potentials.
mines and petroleum minister samuel urkato pointed out that the major factors that contributed to the low performance were peace and security, illegal mining, corruption, and rent-seeking, contraband trade of minerals and shortage of foreign currency for importing inputs have contributed to the income decline from the sector.
about 160 companies are engaged in the sector and the ministry hopes to attract more foreign investors.
other than gold, which is the county’s major export mineral, ethiopia exports: sapphire, opal, tantalum, emerald, gemstones, marble, and other metallic and non-metallic minerals. the country is also endowed with huge deposits of phosphate and potash minerals.
presently, mining contributes only 1 percent of ethiopia’s gdp. gold, industrial minerals and gemstones make the bulk of the mining commodities the country exports. tantalum is also proving to be profitable.
although ministry of mines and petroleum announced that the mining sector in ethiopia is expected to contribute to the transformation of the country from an agriculture led economy to industry, the mineral export earnings, have been declining in the past consecutive years, the sector registered low revenue of 130 million usd in the 2017-2018 fiscal year that ended last june.
the country used to earn more than 600 million usd from the mining sector.in 2011-2012, the nation earned 618 million dollars from mineral exports
in 2014 the country earned about 541 million usd from mining exports. this largely declined because gold production was inefficient. ezana gold mine failed because hard currency was scarce and midroc also had difficulties with complaints from the local community accusing the company of polluting the environment.
midroc gold previously exported four tons of gold per annum from its lega dembi gold mine in oromia regional state."
"for the last three months, tortoises have been sold for 60,000 birr to 400,000 birr at local markets. rumors have spread, falsely claiming that their shells consist of mercury and that this could block phone and internet networks.
what are commonly named leopard tortoises are being sold in debre birhan, gonder, addis ababa, awash and along the borders of djibouti. according to the ethiopian wildlife conservation authority (ewca) there is no tangible evidence that these turtles have the uses they are being sold for.
daniel pawlos, ewca wild life traffic director responded to the problem saying “we are telling people not to be misled by cheaters who tell them to buy tortoises for profit. there are no scientific results indicating that tortoise shells have mercury used for blocking networks and we are expressing this fact to the public.’’
“there are no foreign or local buyers who want the shells of these animals. we have observed people dropping tortoises on the road after they purchase them for a huge sum of money based on false information.’’
“all living creatures in ethiopia have the right to life and protection. we decisively warn against hunting tortoises,” he added. daniel said the only legal way to sell leopard tortoises is by exporting them to the asian market for medicine.
currently an estimated 200,000 leopard tortoises are found in the low land areas of ethiopia. the leopard tortoise species has been listed in appendix ii of cites since 1975 in which trade must be controlled to protect it from extinction. small leopard tortoises are occasionally killed and eaten by pastoralists in southern ethiopia and their empty shells are used as cowbells. while in somalia leopard tortoises are collected mainly for medicinal purposes and considered an aphrodisiac and the turtle-derived medicines are specially used to treat lung diseases such as tuberculosis, asthma and cough. declines in some areas of east africa have been attributed to unsustainable harvest for the pet trade. some tortoises in east african counties including ethiopia have also been known to be killed by frequent fires common in this region, although the species is perceived to hold stable overall. in south sudan, habitat burning impacts may be sufficiently widespread to have impacted populations."
"a senior united nations official has cautioned that the harsh drought conditions currently afflicting much of somalia are likely to trigger a major humanitarian crisis if urgent action is not taken to contain the situation.
the 2019 humanitarian response plan, currently only is funded to 19 percent for the year, which is very worrying with the current extent of the humanitarian crisis that is evolving,” said conway, who is also the united nations resident and humanitarian coordinator.
during a visit, the dsrsg said the situation required strong advocacy with donor and financing partners to bring the humanitarian response up to scale, “so we don’t find ourselves in somalia in a situation where people are moving increasingly into crisis and potentially over the edge into more disastrous conditions.”
according to the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha), drought conditions in the 2018/19 rainy season have led to an increase in the number of people designated as “food insecure” in somalia since october of last year. ocha warned that a deterioration into crisis conditions is expected in many pastoral and agro-pastoral areas during the month of may, due to funding shortfalls that may hamper a full implementation of the planned food assistance.
conway was accompanied by monika agnete pollan thowsen, senior advisor on humanitarian affairs at the norwegian ministry of foreign affairs, svein olav svoldal, first secretary at the royal norwegian embassy in nairobi, and matija kovac, the head of ocha’s humanitarian financing unit.
the day-long trip included a visit to temporary shelters in baidoa to assess the living conditions of internally displaced persons (idps) and weigh up appropriate measures to alleviate their suffering.
the visiting delegation also held discussions on the unfolding humanitarian crisis with the president of south west state, abdiaziz hassan mohamed “laftagareen,” and representatives of non-governmental organizations (ngos) who work with idps.
“today we received a delegation that came to assess the humanitarian situation in south west, particularly in baidoa. we discussed the pressing challenges – mainly the delayed rains, how to scale up humanitarian response, and how to mobilize resources to tackle the drought affecting our people,” president laftagareen said.
last year, a drought spanning four consecutive below average rainy seasons left about 6.2 million people in need of emergency aid such as food, water and shelter. that prompted the un to launch an aid appeal of $1.6 billion to help address the crisis.
to prevent the situation from worsening, the norwegian government is already supporting a number of projects in baidoa and planning to boost humanitarian support in south west state in conjunction with the un.
“we are on a monitoring mission to baidoa together with the un and the somalia humanitarian fund. we have a partnership with the norwegian refugee council and we support save the children. we were able to interact with idp communities and learned the current challenges faced by the growing idp population,” observed thowsen.
noorta abdi osman was displaced by the drought from the settlement of hawaal barbaar, which is situated 30 kilometres outside of baidoa. she lamented the shortage of water and the mounting humanitarian needs at the hawlwadaag camp where she is now living.
“our challenges have doubled since coming here – shortage of water, no food to eat, and no end in sight to the drought. we seek assistance from the international community and the south west administration,” ms. osman said.
fadumo ali mohamed, a 45-year-old mother who was also displaced by the prolonged drought in the bakool region of the state, thanked the donors for constructing a borehole in the hanaano camp because the project has helped alleviate their plight.
the delegation also visited a school project at the hawlwadaag camp to witness the efforts being made by local ngos to educate children uprooted by the ongoing drought."
"the oromia state region is the hub for ethiopian investors but in the last nine months there have been few licenses issued to investors.
oromia provided 2,668 hectares of land to rural investments during the previous fiscal year. this year, however they have only given 259 hectares.
last year 171 plots of land were given to agro processing and service investments in rural areas, however over the last nine months only 22 plots of land have been given out; a dramatic decrease.
the urban investments which are mostly projected to be along the outskirts of addis ababa, adama, bishoftu, dukem, jimma, sebaeta, gelan, bureau, ambo, and welega are also experiencing a big slump.
in addition to the hard currency shortage, some of the manufacturing and hotel projects are also progressing poorly.
in these areas, only 30 plots of land are in the process of being used for investment and ten plots of land were given to the government’s power, electricity, water and telecom service providers through the direct decision of lemma megerssa, who was president of oromia region at the time.
during the last fiscal year the region approved 167 investment projects worth 5.37 billion birr. over 81 percent were in agriculture and agro-processing.
an expert who requested anonymity told capital that the on and off political instability is affecting the investment.
“we have not seen burning factories like a year ago, but the displacement of people, the clashes, the protests occurring throughout the country are affecting the investment inflow. the instability takes the government’s attention and like any other region, the oromia region’s cabinet has been busying itself stabilizing the regions.’’
“insecurity discourages business investment, its scares people. this is because it accelerates the cost of doing business either through direct loss of goods and properties or the cost of taking precautions against business risks and uncertainty. these costs could have a negative impact on business development and progress” the expert added.
prime minister abiy ahmed who was asked about the growing concern of investors at a recent press conference stated that investors should work harmoniously with local communities.
so far, there are over 790 investment projects in the region with a capital of 3.5 billion br. these projects provide employment opportunity for 52,000 employees. additionally, the region accounts for 52 percent of the crop production, 45 percent of the area is cropland and 44 percent of the total livestock population in oromia.
last capital reported that adama youth are blocking containers filled with high-tech apparel machines and equipment, located inside the adama industrial park. they are asking for a hefty sum of money before they are willing to leave. the trucks were blocked for over a week.
youngsters are lying under the truck blocking the movement, just waiting for money. they want to be paid per container and even per single machines.
antex group president quian anuha says, they repeatedly reported the problem to government agencies with no avail. the manager said that he told abebe abebayehu, who runs the ethiopian investment commission, lelise neme, ceo of industrial park development, the major of adama and adama police station but no one responded."
"the federal high court has lifted a ban preventing the founder and shareholders of holland car plc, tadesse tessema from talking to the media regarding the under liquidation firm.
the court stated that the ban, instituted about four years ago, goes against the constitution article 29(2).
that article says: ‘everyone has the right to freedom of expression without any interference. this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any media of their choice.’
tadesse had been prevented from issuing any statement by the federal first instance court since september 2015. the court had appointed a trustee for holland who said it would hinder the liquidation process if tadesse was allowed to give statements to the media.
however, in his appeal to the high court last october, tadesse, a holland diaspora and pioneer in ethiopian car assembly, stated that the liquidation process is in the final stages and only disbursing the money to stakeholders remains to be done.
after tadesse filed suit, asking the high court to lift the ban, the court responded by ruling that the trustee failed to show how tadesse would create a problem with the final money disbursement process and that his constitutional rights were being violated.
recently the cassation bench of federal supreme court suspended holland car plc from settling any payments other than taxes due to the claim of breaching the legal process given by the 5th civil bench of the federal higher court at lideta. the founder claimed that the company was sold for 42 million birr, while the court initially ruled the company should be sold for not less than 50 million birr."
"the addis ababa city government land holding registration and information agency is preparing holding certificates for kebele houses.
the city administration is trying to make sure they know who owns each house so they have been registering private and public land holdings throughout addis. they also have started registering the so-called kebele houses that were nationalized in 1975 during the derge government.
the agency already started gathering the necessary information in which demarcating the boundary based on the directives to give title deeds for kebele houses.
“the houses lacking title deeds have been a problem for the agency because it is hard to prevent illegal activities,” says liben feyera, the agency’s communication director.
the kebele houses are prone to corruption and illegal transfer. corrupt officials would eliminate the record and transfer the homes to private owners, according to liben.
the holding certificate is issued in the name of the woreda administration office where the kebele houses exist.
the agency is working on strict procedures preparing the certificate. they have a secret print and bar code. the agency is also pays attention to preparing the certificate and follows both officials and officers in charge closely.
from the registered 153, thousand kebele houses in addis ababa, more than 26 thousand kebele houses that qualify for title deeds have been sent for certification. the highest number of residential houses are located in addis ketema sub-city while the lowest are in bole sub city.
kebele houses, were nationalized in 1975 during the derge government and rented to citizens at the low price of 1birr and 50 cents to 18 birr per month. in most cases it is occupied by one family and can be transferred from one generation to the next. the houses are in very low physical quality, made out of mud and wood and are located in overcrowded areas.
according to the un-habitat definition, 80 percent of addis ababa housing is a slum, and 70 percent of these homes are government-owned rental houses.
“the certification process will be finalized up to the end this fiscal year,” liben added."
"the ministry of trade and industry (moti), is yet to issue an expected directive that would allow exporters of soy and mung beans, who bought the products before the ethiopian commodity exchange (ecx) took exclusive trading rights a few months ago, to recommence their export. those affected are opposed to paying a commission to ecx.
the exporters said they bought the beans before the ecx took over the trading, now they say they are unable to export their product.
“moti has provided a permit letter showing the product was bought before ecx started the trading, which allows us to get a permit at the customs office for export but now we heard that the ministry has suspended issuing this letter,” one of the exporters, who asked to be anonymous told capital.
“i bought 9,000 quintals of soybeans in october, which is the beginning month for harvest season, but now they are saying i have to settle the commission fee with ecx which is unfair,” he added.
ecx, the modern trading floor which began operating in april 2008, officially started the exclusive trading of soy and mung beans in january. it says exporters were buying the beans on the primary market even after the trading was fully transferred to ecx.
it banned some exporters from exporting the beans, accusing them illegally buying the products from primary markets.
last week the ethiopian pulses, oilseeds and spices processors-exporters association called members who were banned from exporting the products. they asked them to say how much volume they had purchased.
sources said that the ministry was expected to issue a directive allowing exporters to recommence their export after settling the commission at ecx this week. however, the directive had not been issued when the paper went to print.
some exporters also argued that the current decision is unacceptable since they bought the product months before the commodity market started the exclusive trading in january.
moti is expected to issue a directive allowing exporters who bought the products against the market rule to export the products since they settled the charges that were supposed to be paid to ecx if the products were bought from the electronic trading center. the government is now attempting to obtain the hard currency from the export of those suspended from exporting, according to the sector expert."
"the minister of agriculture and natural resources, oumer hussien told lawmakers that the ministry will purchase fertilizer for next year’s harvest to ensure farmers get it on time.
although this is uncommon, it is being done because the supply chain is ineffective. farmers’ productivity has been going down because fertilizer and other agricultural inputs are not being distributed on time. in some places even after the “belg” seasons begins farmers don’t have what they need to plant.
according to the world bank, over 70 percent of the households reported that fertilizer is often supplied late and around 40 percent of the households reported that supplies were inadequate. high prices and tight credit repayment schedules constrain fertilizer use.
transportation cost is another major contributor to the high cost of fertilizers, there is seasonal variation of demand and there is lack of information and communication among stakeholders in the fertilizer supply chain.
state minister, sani redi argues that low productivity increases fertilizer prices and that other factors remain constant.
according to the ministry of agriculture, over half a billion usd has been used to buy 1.27 million tons of fertilizer. currently, 49 percent has entered the country and the rest is expected to arrive by the end of may.
the country’s fertilizer supply has been increasing and ethiopia has been importing more agricultural inputs. in 2017 the country spent 16 billion birr to purchase 936,430 tons of fertilizer of which 70 percent was bought from ocp, a moroccan company.
the country had been using only dap and urea fertilizers which solely gives nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. however, the ministry is working to apply the fertilizers that almost incorporated the nutrients recommended by researchers including potash, sulfur, boron and zinc among others in accordance with the type of soil.
in ethiopia over 95 percent of fertilizers are distributed by cooperative unions.
six years ago the country attempted to manufacture 300,000 tons of urea, 250,000 tons of dap fertilizers, 20,000 tons of other fertilizers in yayu wereda, illubabor zone of oromia regional state, the project failed.
another joint venture agreement with ocp in dire dawa will began soon, according to the ministry.
“the ministry is simultaneously working to save foreign currency along with delivering on time at a low cost,” said oumar hussein."
"a group of people living near the addis ababa abattoirs enterprise commonly known as kera, have brought a complaint letter to the addis ababa environmental protection authority saying that the foul smell coming from the abattoir is creating health problems.
they say over 150 residents are being affected by the bad odor coming from the cooking kitchen and the byproducts of waste from the abattoirs.
a resident around the area told capital “there is a disgusting smell on a regular basis. it starts at 4 pm and continues for four hours. the stench causes breathing difficulty and we can’t relax or sleep well. we have written a letter to the enterprise but they have not given us a satisfactory response.”
residents say the stench has been an issue for years and they are unhappy that this has been continuing. they want public officials to do more to eliminate the odor.
“if they could live here and see what it’s like in the evenings, the decision makers that could do something about it, would do something about it,” the resident adds.
nebret beka, managing director of the enterprise told capital that the bad smell is happening because dump trucks in the city are unwilling to load the waste from the abattoirs.
“it can take at least two or three days until the truck comes to us to load the waste, we told them to load it every day but they are get paid by cubic meters in other places, we are asking the city administration for our own dump truck.”
“we are committed to being a good neighbor and we take our community responsibility seriously. we appreciate the concerns that have been expressed and continue to evaluate and address the situation, including the source of the odor and ways in which we can help further address it. we have already taken significant strides in that direction, including preparing ourselves for a better waste management system. we are in touch with experts and soon they will come here to conduct a study’’ the managing director adds.
in related news, the new abattoir located at hana mariam is being challenged by delays in the relocation of the residents of the area.
“there are around 55 legal homes here so the city administration is working to give them better compensation but the process is taking a long time. over 350 houses are constructed illegally. the project site is owned by us but all of these issues are creating a headache for us. we are in the process of hiring a consultant for the new abattoirs. we plan to begin the construction in july,” nebret said.
in september 2017, ethiopia and france signed a 70.5 million euro loan and grant agreement to support the relocation and expansion of the addis ababa abattoirs enterprise.
the new encompass lied on 17,400 square meters and it is going to have the capacity to handle 14,000 animals per day. compared to this, the old slaughter house has the capacity of only slaughtering 1,200 animals per day.
the old abattoir has seen some improvements in the past years. nonetheless, expansion and improvement projects faced difficulties due to space limitation. with the new slaughter house, the enterprise expects to render different new services such as export slaughtering service and environmental mitigation actions.
the export service is expected to be given through an automatic line which can handle bulls, sheep and goats.
an upgrading system for processing by products to produce animal tallow, meat bone meal, glue and pure bone meal will also be installed in the new abattoir. in addition to these the new abattoir will feature a biogas plant and water treatment plant to enable the treatment of water and reuse of water."
"unicef has released a global report on early childhood education showing that ethiopia’s commitment to promoting pre-primary education has led to an increase in gross enrollment from less than two per cent in 2000 to more than 45 per cent in 2017. however, despite these impressive gains, more than half of children of pre-primary age across the country remain excluded, contributing to the 175 million children missing out on pre-primary education globally.
the report notes that the growth in pre-primary enrollment in ethiopia was encouraged by the national policy framework for early childhood care and education, which focused on making one year of pre-primary education widely available for children. however, this growth has not been even as evidenced by persistently huge variations across regions. for example, while addis ababa and tigray have high gross enrolments rates of 93 per cent and 88 per cent respectively, only 4.5 per cent of children in the somali region and 14 per cent in the afar region are enrolled.
countries with the highest numbers of children not in pre-primary education are missing a critical opportunity to build human resources and are at risk of suffering deep inequalities from the start, the report notes. in low-income countries, on average only 1 in 5 young children are enrolled in pre-primary education.
“pre-primary education is foundational for our children’s success in primary and secondary education and beyond,” said gillian mellsop, unicef’s representative in ethiopia. “yet too many children in ethiopia are denied this opportunity. this increases their risk of repeating grades or dropping out of school altogether and relegates them to the shadows of their more fortunate peers.”
a world ready to learn: prioritizing quality early childhood education – unicef’s first ever global report on pre-primary education – reveals that children enrolled in at least one year of pre-primary education are more likely to develop the critical skills they need to succeed in school, less likely to repeat grades or drop out of school, and therefore more able to contribute to peaceful and prosperous societies and economies when they reach adulthood.
children in pre-primary education are more than twice as likely to be on track in early literacy and numeracy skills than children missing out on early learning. in countries where more children attend pre-primary programmes, significantly more children complete primary school and attain minimum competencies in both reading and math by the time they finish primary school. a 2016 study by young lives, a collaborative research project led by a team from oxford university, found that urban children in ethiopia who attended pre-primary education were 26 per cent more likely to complete secondary education at the proper age than their non-pre-school counterparts.
globally, the report notes that household wealth, mothers’ education level and geographical location are among the key determinants for pre-primary attendance. however, poverty is the single largest determinant. across 64 countries, the poorest children are seven times less likely than children from the wealthiest families to attend early childhood education programmes.
across countries with available data, children born to mothers who have completed secondary education and above are nearly five times more likely to attend an early childhood education programme than children whose mothers have completed only primary education or have no formal education.
in 2017 an average of 6.6 per cent of domestic education budgets globally were dedicated to pre-primary education, with nearly 40 per cent of countries with data allocating less than 2 per cent of their education budgets to this sub-sector.
this lack of worldwide investment in pre-primary education negatively impacts quality of services, including a significant lack of trained pre-primary teachers. together, low- and lower middle-income countries are home to more than 60 per cent of the world’s pre-primary-age children, but scarcely 32 per cent of all pre-primary teachers. ethiopia currently has only 23,000 pre-primary teachers and needs nearly half a million by 2030."
"although, ethiopia has spent over three billion usd for telecom infrastructure by rolling out over 17 thousand fiber optic cables across the country, the business community is asking for more. they say more reliable ict infrastructure is needed to grow the business environment.
“most government portals such as wereda net have failed to provide services which means increased costs and wasted time for the business community,” messay hailmariam, ceo of ronbit consultancy said in a study he presented.
of 33 federal institutions only six currently provide online service, according to the minister of innovation and technology.
the limited capacity of ict infrastructure and the failure to develop government portals are another problem.
“the ministry of innovation and technology is working to improve the limited capacity of wereda.net by increasing the speed and bandwidth to modernize the country’s information technology system,” getahun mekuria minister of innovation and technology said.
“the costly internet will not make the ethiopian business community competitive with international firms,” messay adds.
“developing a strategy for fostering mobile money services, can be a key enabler for improving access to finance that contributes for the growth of business in the country as business without ict development is unthinkable,” messay says.
according to a study the slow implementation of national ict strategies and programs, limited capacity and underutilized infrastructure such as fiber optics, data centers and lack of an on-line payment platform through which companies can buy/sell challenges the growth of business in ethiopia.
it recommended that the government intervene to accelerate the rollout of high-speed broadband infrastructure and attract foreign firms and support business innovation and productivity across the economy in addition to pushing forward plans of partially privatizing the state-owned monopoly operator, ethio-telecom in hopes of bringing opportunity to enhance the benefits of advancement in communication infrastructures."
"boeing ceo dennis muilenburg has said “it’s apparent” that the 737 max 8’s mcas maneuvering system contributed to two fatal air accidents. investigators had long suspected the system’s role in the disasters, after the preliminary findings on et 302 crash was released by the ministry of transport.
ethiopian airlines flight 302 plunged into a field shortly after takeoff in march, killing all 157 people on board. indonesian lion air flight 610 nosedived into the sea last october, killing all 189 passengers and crew. investigators noted “clear similarities” between both accidents.
“the full details of what happened in the two accidents will be issued by the government authorities in the final reports,” muilenburg said in a video posted thursday. “it’s apparent that in both flights the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, known as mcas, activated in response to the erroneous angle of attack information,” he added.
dagmawit moges minister of transport said “on the basis of initial information gathered during the course of investigation the facts have been determined”. the flight 302’s crew “had performed all the procedures, repeatedly, provided by boeing, but was not able to control the aircraft” she said.
she further added that first the aircraft possessed a valid certificate of air worthiness, the crew obtained the license and qualification to conduct the flight and the takeoff rule appeared normal including normal, values of left and right angle-of-attack (aoa) safety recommendation
“after takeoff repetitive un-commanded aircraft nose down conditions are noticed in this preliminary investigation, it is recommended that aircraft flight control system related to flight controllability shall be reviewed by the manufacturer” she added.
the mcas system reads the 737 max’s angle of attack (the angle of the plane’s nose) through a nose-mounted sensor. if the nose drifts too far upward, it manipulates the tail to keep the plane level and avoid a stall. however, investigators and boeing whistleblowers claim that the sensors can deliver false readings, and the system can overcompensate, throwing the aircraft into a dive.
the 737 max 8 is grounded worldwide following the ethiopian airlines disaster, and boeing is currently previewing a software update that muilenberg said will “eliminate the possibility” of a similar accident happening again. the update will need to be approved by air regulators worldwide before the 737 max will take to the sky again.
a group of boeing engineers told the seattle times last month that pilots were unaware of how to override the mcas system, and boeing has promised to rectify this too by providing “additional educational materials.” in addition, two critical safety features that could have warned pilots of an impending dive were sold as optional extras by the manufacturer. one of these – a warning light – will now be fitted as standard.
with the troubled jet grounded worldwide, attention has since focused on the federal aviation administration’s certification of the jet. a us senate investigation is now focusing on examining whether the faa’s inspectors were properly trained, and the department of transport is also forming a commission to review the faa’s certification process.
in the aftermath of the most recent crash, a group of faa and boeing engineers claimed that the faa delegated much of its safety review of the 737 max 8 to boeing itself, and trusted the company’s conclusions. they also claimed that boeing downplayed safety concerns involving the mcas system to bring the jetliner to market faster.
there are also reports that us and european regulators knew at least two years before a lion air crash that the usual method for controlling the boeing 737 max’s nose angle might not work in conditions similar to those in two recent disasters.
the european aviation and space agency (easa) certified the plane as safe in part because it said additional procedures and training would “clearly explain” to pilots the “unusual” situations in which they would need to manipulate a rarely-used manual wheel to control, or “trim”, the plane’s angle.
those situations, however, were not listed in the flight manual, according to a copy from american airlines.
the undated easa certification document, available online, was issued in february 2016.
easa and the us federal aviation administration (faa) ultimately determined that set-up was safe enough for the plane to be certified, with the european agency citing training plans and the relative rarity of conditions requiring the trim wheel."
"yinager dessie (phd) governor of the central banks told members of parliament that financial institutions are being targeted by looters after unexpected unrest in some parts of the country.
financial institutions are in critical condition, the governor said, to members of parliament who questioned the amount of money stolen in the western part of oromia regional state recently.
“there was just under 15 million birr stolen from 11 branches of six banks,” he said.
banks were also victimized when unrest occurred in jigjiga in somali regional state last august. when unrest broke out, mobs vandalized the banks there, causing 41 million birr in losses.
“in any instance, when there is unrest, looters find a way to rob banks. the central bank can’t protect them unless we work together with regional governments and security institutions,” yinager said.
in the last seven months, there been 18 more bank branches were opened. two of these are government owned. there are over five thousand branches and sub branches all over the country which is an increase of 14.4 percent. the two government owned banks have a market share of 30 percent share while 16 private banks holds the remaining 70 percent.
“the increase in the number of branches even exceeds what the government planed to achieve in the second edition of gtp,” he said."
"ethiopia imports over 5,900 items annually, these include: finished goods, raw materials for light industries, fresh food items for processing, and packed agricultural products. ethiopia, which primarily exports agricultural products, currently has exported 220 items. imports of food items have significantly increased. eighty percent of ethiopia’s labor force and foreign currency earnings come from agricultural exports. the government says agricultural development and achievement will lead to industrialization. this is called agricultural development led industrialization (adli).
however, ethiopia’s agricultural performance has been trending downward recently.
some who work in the profession say agriculture has not been given the attention it needs by the government. they argue that political decisions have factored into agriculture’s poor performance. the government counters that is has provided incentives for farmers and agriculture related businesses.
figures indicate that agriculture is the country’s major economic backbone, but it has not received adequate support in terms of finance or allowing modern agricultural equipment to be imported duty free.
for example, the national bank of ethiopia’s (nbe) latest economic outlook for the first quarter of the fiscal year shows that the major beneficiary of bank loans was industry, which accounted for 28.8 percent. this was followed by domestic trade (18.3 percent), international trade (14.6 percent), housing and construction (12.9 percent), and agriculture (10 percent). however, agriculture and related businesses, account for 83.9 percent of exports and 80 percent of the labor force. but only 10 percent of loans have gone to agriculture.
in terms of outstanding credit,agriculture took only 18.7 billion birr or 4.6 percent, while according to the central statistical agency’s recent report, farming householdshave reached 14.9 million and 566,000 new farmers become smallholder farmers every year.
the government says efforts are being exerted to scale up the utilization of improved seeds but only 15 percent of farmers are now using such seeds in ethiopia, but, the demand for improved seeds has recently risen from eight million to 18 million quintals. at the same time less than 30 percent of farmers use fertilizer.
regarding the fertilizer usage from the 13 million hectares that are cultivated in the country the majority or 70 percent are not using fertilizer for their farming.
studies indicated that agriculture is dominated by small-scale farmers who practice rain-fed mixed farming by employing traditional technology, adopting a low-input and low-output production system. land title deeds owned by small-scale farmers, accounts for 95% of the total area under agricultural use in ethiopia, and these farmers are responsible for more than 90% of the total agricultural output.
studies that capital reviewed stated that policy makers and donor agencies have emphasized the use of modem farm technologies as a sole source of agricultural growth in ethiopia. however, the cost of modern technologies is so prohibitive that few farmers in limited areas are using them. therefore, it is high time to explore possibilities for identifying approaches that could complement existing strategies of growth.
experts that capital talked said there should be incentives in agriculture in areas like taxes and duties because it is a priority area for export earnings, jobs and revenue in general.
they argued that the majority of smallholder farmers have been neglected by the government. experts expressed disagreement with the government’s policy because it providesincentives and subsidies for other parts of the economy like industry and service over agriculture.
demese chanyalew (phd) is an agricultural economist, with four decades of experience, including published writings and studies. he made several assessments when he spoke to capital about the state of agriculture in ethiopia. since, agriculture is the pioneer of ethiopia’s economy, he said, the government needs to prioritize incentives in this sector more than industry or service in order for the country to really grow.
access to finance is a major problem in his opinion.
“initially agriculture does not have access to adequate capital. this is despite the fact that agriculture is being relied on to achieve many things in the millennium development goals and sustainable development goals,” he said.
demese, who leads the consultancy firm demarethio-africa plc, said that today the number of farmers using improved seeds is less than 15 percent out of the 17 million farmers in the country, while only 30 percent use fertilizer. this indicates that there is a fundamental exclusion from capital. “agricultural machines are another thing that has never been implemented in the country.”
farming is a source of 80 percent of hard currency that the country uses to import capital goods for industries and other products but agriculture fails to get two percent from importing capital goods. this indicates the agriculture is literality denied from capital from inside and outside.
even though agriculture generates hard currency, its volume is being underutilized, according to experts.
from the total investment allocation, agriculture secured only 10 percent. bear in mind from the stated 10 percent one percent of the contributors work in the agricultural industry, and they are unable to settle their development bank of ethiopia 6.5 billion birr debt, but they took 70 or above share from the ten percent. the farmers that produce the 99 percent took the balance.
these figures indicate that smallholder farmers are excluded from finance and capital.
gebremichael habte, an agronomist and consultant for several local and international agribusinesses and agricultural product exporters, agreed that the major exporters in fruit and vegetables are small holder farmers.
however, they have not used any improved mechanisms to produce more products due to lack of equipment and finance.
“big farms that we did not see exporting fruits and vegetables particularly in the regional markets are accessing several incentives including duty free and tax holidays besides accessing the finance without any preconditions,” he said.
“based on the study we conducted about a decade ago and its recommendation it stated that to support food product producers like relevant massive producers and farmer unions to access incentives like flower farms secured,” the agricultural economist said.
he said that the stated incentive is accepted in principle and the lease finance proposed, but in reality the government is using it for industry because that is where their focus is.
regarding the tax incentive, the government is giving attractive schemes for several local and international investors. in agriculture the government is providing tax and duty incentives but the number of investors is very limited and they contribute less than one percent to agriculture.
many who work in farm related businesses argue this point gebremichael says “if you are an agricultural investor you can import any piece of agricultural equipment duty free. for instance, a tractor, while the other person who is belongs to a group of smallholder farmers or an individual that wants to import a tractor to rent to farmers is expected to pay the duty and other taxes to import the product.”
“how can agriculture grow without allowing and imposing high restrictions and tariffs on the wide range of the farming contributors to imports or easily accessing semi or fully advanced ethnologies,” gebremichael inquired.
“even though investors are supported in many ways the household farmers are the major hard currency earners for the country, for instance the fruit and vegetable export to djibouti or somaliland is from householder farmers,” the agronomist said.
“at the same time even though the investors secured incentives there is not that much success stories coming from them,” the expert argued.
demese says statistics indicate that 73 percent of the employment is from agriculture, while some agricultural related businesses would increase that percentage to 78 percent.
however, the government stated that about 80 percent of the tax revenue, including high tax payers are source of 75 percent of government revenue on tax and duty, demese argued.
they argued that ethiopian farmers pay the most taxes in the country. “the government has to stop its elitist approach and accept the reality to understand agriculture,” he said.
“these stated companies are tax collectors for the government in the form of vat or tot. this shows there is a massive amount of tax. the industry and trade companies which are allowed many tax cuts are bankrupt,” the agro economist said.
“we shall see this according to macro economics; consumption, tax and saving in one direction regarding national wealth and investment, consumption and government expenditure on the other side. when we see the first component the country’s gdp tax ratio is 12 percent, while net consumption is from 65 to 70 percent that shows consumers are generating the majority of tax,” demise explained. farmers are not even exempted tax when they buy things like pickup trucks for their farms.
“this shows who should benefit from tax exemption,” he said.
experts at donor and nongovernmental organizations add that supporters who want to provide agricultural equipment like irrigation pipelines are unable to attain their target because the products will be unaffordable for farmers due to tax imposed on freely imported products.
“there are some institutions that want to support the farmers’ productivity by supplying modern equipment, but they are unable to meet their target due to the tax are imposed on the products which escalates the price of the product and makes it expensive for the farmers,” on expert said.
demise argued that smallholder farmers must modernize and commercialize farmers since they are 99 percent of local consumption or export producers. he explained that prudent measures had to be supported. “the farmer is trying to modernize production. they have difficulty finding equipment to improve their production but they don’t get the products from the market since it is not imported as a priority or they are expensive due to high tax and duties like other goods,” he said.
for instance, the adama assembled tractors were not able to be owned by farmers due to lack of finance, according to the expert.
demese claimed that tax exemption is secondary. he said the priority was making high quality and reasonably priced agricultural products, from seed to tractor, accessible to farmers.
“we have frequently argued that agriculture has to have the privileges that other economic sectors have. agriculture products like veterinary products, animal feed and others are taxed while hotel investors can import tv’s and other products for free. it is ridiculous,” he said.
he stressed that the tax exemption rules need reformed especially when it comes to agriculture.
according to the data from ministry of revenue in the first six months of the current budget year, the government has given 65.8 billion birr. demise said that the stated exempted amount was not given to agriculture. instead it went to industry and service. however, it was supposed to be for agriculture, he said.
experts said that from diary to crop production the farmers must be equipped with modern tools through tax subsidies or exemptions.
regarding modernization, the farmer is far from accessing from the biggest tractor to seed or animal feed due to lack of incentives and exemption on tax. people who work in agricultural businesses that capital spoke with said that unless farming in modernized to improve their production and irrigation, then development is not possible, and goals won’t be met. they said that the government has to reconsider its policy that focuses on the agriculture than the so called industry and other s meanwhile the later shall also get support but to be considered as secondary.
farmers who have between two and five hectares of land will be included in the incentives, according to the expert.
irrigation support is crucial but it needs to be followed up closely to help farmer’s cultivating stimulant products like khat.
demise said that the government seems to be getting back on track. at least now we are listening to each other, which is priority for growth. “surprisingly last may the government organized a think tank event, through its own initiative, and assessed areas including agricultural and rural transformation. they examined reasons for the country’s failure to achieve the results they wanted and weaknesses in agriculture. then they came up with a list of solutions,” demise, one of the four presenters at the event explained. he said that shows things are improving.
capital learned that the ministry of agriculture is forming a think tank chaired by the minister himself which will include several sub committees made up of business and government representatives working in many agricultural sub-sectors.
eight intervention areas have been selected for agriculture. these include: extension work, research, capacity building, transforming to a modern system, marketing and finance; mechanization, sustainable natural utilization and conservation; linkage and coordinating.
capital has attempted to obtain information from the pubic relations head at the ministry of finance, which is responsible for drafting incentive laws. capital also attempted to speak with the ministry of agriculture, which works on tax issues. both agencies declined to comment and said that they are not aware if incentive laws for smallholder farmers are being drafted.
recently pm abiy ahmed said irrigation will get more attention but details have not been specified yet."
"the federal first instance court gives has ruled against zemen bank, who sued the under liquidation holland car plc, for 20 million birr.the court said that the bank, which was the major lender for the first local car assembly company, wanted close to 10.6 million birr to cover the cost of car parts and transportation from the port in djibouti to mojo, which is a center for assembly, and customs and other payments.the bank also wanted over 9.6 million birr in interest and a six percent commission.they had attempted to get paid through a liquidity supervision commission for holland car plc, which was assigned by the court about five years ago to handle the process of dissolving the company. however, the commission did not agree to do this.zemen argued that they should be awarded transportation costs and other expenses but the court ruled that their documents and arguments did not provide enough evidence that they had paid the amount they claimed to transport car parts.the verdict also ruled that the bank was not entitled to interest.holland car was declared bankrupt by the lideta federal high court on january 21, 2013, after which it was decided that the company would not pay any of its debts starting from two years prior, in january, 2011.the court said the bank’s request went against the spirit of the liquidation process. the court indicated that filing the case to the court after the bank tried to solve the process through the commission, who is only responsible for settling the liquidation is unacceptable.the court has also added that the bank’s evidences did not support their argument that they should cover the cost of transporting the cargo imported to be assembled from the port. the final decision of the court stated that there is no evidence that show the bank paid the logistics cost.as a result, it rejected the over 20 million birr claim of zemen bank.the pioneer car assembly was founded in 2005 via a joint venture between tadesse tessema and trento engineering, a dutch company with an initial capital of 11 million birr."
"sugar prices are becoming bitter as they rise to 21 birr per kilo in a move to help mills cover production costs.it’s a significant jump from the current 18.40 per kilo price that has been in effect for the last four years. this will likely affect drink and food prices as they include the sweet.the city of addis ababa gets 120,000 quintals of sugar from the sugar corporation. they then distribute it to consumer’s associations and etfruit, which in turn serves the end user. previously the sugar corporation sold sugar at 1,400 birr per quintal but they have raised the price to 1,641 birr per quintal.  regional states will likely increase sugar prices as well although the exact amount will vary.sources close to the issue told capital that a price hike has been in the pipeline but that they wanted to wait until the old stock was sold.“we didn’t want to mix the old stock with the new stock so we held off on the price hike but now it will go into effect. even though cane is planted here companies are experiencing trouble due to the high raw material cost because they import from abroad.’’the corporation imports over three million quintals of sugar annually to fill the supply gaps that occur due to the recurring shortage.according to the public relations head of the sugar corp; sugar factories in  metehara, wonji, fincha, kesem, arjo, tendaho and kuraz 2, and kuraz  have a sugarcane crushing capacity of 5,000, 6,250, 12,000, 6,000, 8,000, 13,000 and 12,000 tons per day respectively. but this does not indicate the current actual production, only their capacity.
even though the government had plans to construct and commence production of ten new sugar factories during the first gtp (2010-2015), almost all of its projections failed.
in the past year tendaho and kesem which commenced over a decade ago and kuraz 2, which was constructed by the chinese company have been finished.
most of the others were managed by metec a state industry developer. some of these have been delayed of have performed weakly. the government has stated that sugar would be a major source of hard currency, but that has failed to materialize.globally the sugar industry has been in turmoil since the eu scrapped production and export quotas in 2017, prompting many producers to boost output just as sugar prices collapsed under pressure from large world stocks."
"after the troubled boeing max 737 was grounded around the world, airlines are beginning to demand compensation from the manufacturer as revenue losses are expected to mount.
european low cost airline norwegian air, which has eighteen 737 max 8 planes in its fleet, has become the first airline to say publicly it will demand that boeing pay for lost flight time.
“it is quite obvious we will not take the cost related to the new aircraft that we have to park temporarily,” norwegian ceo bjørn kjos said in a recorded message to customers. “we will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft.”
the majority of norwegian’s 737 max aircraft serve intra-european routes. the airline has also used the more fuel-efficient aircraft on trans-atlantic routes. it has ordered more than 100 of the 737 max 8 planes.
another budget carrier, india’s spicejet, also said it will seek compensation from boeing and demand credit on maintenance, repair, and overhaul for its 12 grounded 737 max aircraft. the airline had an aggressive expansion plan that banked on the delivery of max jets. it will now have to lease old planes.
however, ethiopian airlines official said that the airline did not make any claim until now.
operated by ethiopian airlines, the boeing 737-8 max went down in an area called ejere, near bishoftu, southeast of addis ababa killing all 157 passengers from 35 countries on board. many were involved in humanitarian work and attending a united nations environmental conference in nairobi that begins the next day.
on monday, ethiopian airlines grounded its remaining four, 737 max planes followed by several other airlines all over the world, citing similarities between the march 10 ethiopian airlines crash and the lion air crash in october last year.
the federal aviation administration (faa) ordered the temporary grounding of all 737 max aircraft operated by us airlines or in us airspace on wednesday. the agency made this decision as a result of the data gathering process and new evidence collected at the site and analyzed the faa said in a statement, shortly after us president donald trump announced the planes would be grounded.
the evidence, together with newly refined satellite data available to faa on led to this decision by adding that the grounding will remain in effect as the faa investigates.
following the grounding of the 737 max planes, boeing shares fell by nearly three percent. the aircraft maker’s stock has gone down by at least 13 percent since the ethiopian airlines crash on sunday, boeing’s stock has lost more than 10 percent of its value, wiping out more than 25 billion usd of the company’s market value.
meanwhile, ethiopian airlines vows to support families of the victims by supplying all logistic services and providing any information according to esayas w/mariam vice ceo of ethiopian airlines who met with diplomats of the respective countries who gathered at the premise of ministry of foreign affairs. compensation for families will be given based on international laws.
on thursday, ethiopian airlines organized a memorial service for the victims, including eight crew members, taking the unusual step of busing in relatives and neighbors from around the country to a crash site that is still the focus of an active investigation, in addition to opening a call-in centre that is open 18 hours a day to respond to questions.
the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder have been recovered from the wreckage of ethiopian airlines flight et302 in which investigators will hope the black box can explain why the plane crashed six minutes after takeoff. 
“an ethiopian delegation led by the accident investigation bureau (aib) has flown the flight data recorder (fdr) and cockpit voice recorder (cvr) to paris, france for investigation,” the airline said in a statement.
investigators are trying to determine the cause of the plane crash in bishoftu on sunday, there are local and international experts involved in the process, reports have suggested.
aircraft manufacturing company boeing announced a technical team which has since arrived on the site of the ethiopian airlines flight that killed 157 people to provide technical assistance.
one central question investigators will address is whether the software known as maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (mcas) used on the 737 max to prevent stalling was central to the accident. lion air officials have said sensors on their crashed plane produced erroneous information on its last four flights, triggering an automatic nose-down command that the pilots were unable to overcome on its final flight.
ethiopian airlines have a good reputation for safety. the last major accident involving an ethiopian airlines passenger plane was in 2010, when a boeing 737-800 exploded after taking off from lebanon, killing 83 passengers and seven crew members. the investigation of this crash has not yet been official.
the airline currently flies to over 50 african cities in what is the largest network by a national carrier. it is also in talks to help about a dozen african countries to establish and manage their carriers. "
"pm, students engage all female courtthe federal supreme court cassation bench agreed to hear a case of an eleven-year-old who was convicted of ordinary homicide at a regional high court. that court, located in the southern nations, nationalities and peoples (snnp) region, ruled on july 25, 2017, that the accused boy killed his friend intentionally and ordered that he serve three years in a juvenile detention facility.
grima, (not his real name) was convicted of killing another young boy, getachew, (also a pseudonym) on the afternoon of may 19, 2017. the incident occurred when the two boys were playing near their homes. girma became angry after getachew hit gima’s little brother so girma threw a rock at getachew, which caused brain damage and eventually killed him, according to the lower court’s statement.
after hearing witness testimony and receiving an autopsy report from st. paul’s hospital the high court convicted girma of ordinary homicide and sentenced him to three years.
the sentencing guidelines for ordinary homicide, (addressed in articles 539-541 of the criminal code), are between five and twenty years.
the child’s defense lawyer was assigned by the court. that lawyer appealed the case at the snnp supreme court. on february 9, 2018 that court upheld the lower court’s decision. however, one judge, petros bine, wrote a minority opinion.
“the case was held in the private chambers of a judge (in-camera) only at a hearing for the defendant’s witnesses. the defense lawyer appeared that day but not at the previous hearing,” he said.
he went on to disagree with the charge of ordinary homicide, he felt the case did not fall under article 540 of the criminal code. he also said it was not right that the child would be in court, or plea without his lawyer present. if a crime can lead to a 10-year prison sentence, he said then there must be a defense lawyer present when witnesses are heard and pleas are made, he argued. if that wasn’t possible then the case should have been adjourned to another day.
girma’s real name is not being used in the court due to his age. as a result the appeal was entitled: “cassation over cassation”.
girma’s lawyer appealed to the federal supreme court cassation bench which is called the federal cassation bench, chaired by chief justice meaza ashenafi.
the bench referred to the united nations convention on the rights of the child (crc) article 3 and the fdre constitution article 36 which prioritize the ‘best interest of the child.’
“children who are accused of breaking the law have the right to legal help and fair treatment in a justice system that respects their rights. governments are required to set a minimum age below which children cannot be held criminally responsible and to provide minimum guarantees for the fairness and quick resolution of judicial or alternative proceedings,” reads article 40 of the convention.
in the judges’ opinion the only reason to send a juvenile to jail would be under article 162 of the criminal code.
“the court may order admission into a special institution for the correction and rehabilitation of young criminals, taking into account the bad character, antecedents or disposition of the young criminal as well as the gravity of the crime and the circumstances under which it was committed,” reads the first paragraph of article 162 of the code.
“according to the constitution any decision which doesn’t respect these principles is baseless and a violation to citizens’ basic rights,” reads the judgment.
since the child is 11 years his plea will be valid only if he was represented by his lawyer, the court ruled. they criticized the lower court for failing to ensure the best interest of the child.
they also referred to judge petros’s opinion about the lack of appropriate measures taken to respect the child’s rights.
“we found decision given by the lower court in violation of the international and continental conventions of which ethiopia is a signatory, the constitution, the criminal code, the criminal procedure code and in basic error of law,” stated the ruling given by the seven judges.
the all-female bench ordered the high court to proceed with the case privately, to make sure the child is represented by a defense lawyer and to follow the un article. the judges also said article 53 of the criminal code should be used for sentencing guidelines, if the accused is found guilty.
“where a crime is committed by young person between the ages of nine and fifteen years, the penalties and measures to be imposed by the courts shall be only those provided in articles 157-168 of this code. the young person shall not be subject to the ordinary penalties applicable to adults nor shall they be kept in custody with adult criminals,” reads article 53.
the referred articles provide alternatives to be used to correct young offenders. they include: admission to a curative institution, supervised education, reprimand; censure, school or home arrest and admission to a corrective institution.
the judges declared that every decision given by the lower court to be dismissed. the judges ordered the discharge of the child if he is in detention.
the case which was decided on international women’s day was ruled on by seven judges. this was an extra ordinary event in the country’s legal history. on the day more than 300 students attended the hearing and asked questions regarding their rights.
the session was also attended by the prime minister abiy ahemd (phd).
during this time female students asked what the government was doing to protect them from cat calling and daily harassment. they also raised questions related to marital violence and the inclusion of females’ rights under a chapter dealing with human and democratic rights.
the seven judges of the top court shared their experiences with the audience which included first year and second year law school students from universities."
"after ethiopia lifted the ban on domestic workers moving overseas and passed a new law to guard against ill-treatment, over 100,000 job orders have come in from saudi arabia to hire ethiopians as domestic workers primarily in housekeeping and caregiving.
saudi families offered jobs through 340 local agencies registering domestic workers in line with the country’s new laws. domestic workers who wish to travel to approved countries must have proper training in their field from vocational schools.
the vocational school trainings which take from one to three months, focus on housekeeping, caregiving and domestic work like driving cars. so far 140 agencies have registered to send domestic workers to the destination countries.
one hundred thousand citizens, mostly women are registered to go to saudi, but none of them have completed the long process of taking trainings and competency certificates.
assefa yirgalem, public relation head of ministry of labor and social affairs told capital that the domestic workers will start to go soon after they complete the legal process here.
“it is not like the past, when a person wants to go abroad they must have completed eighth grade and three months training from vocational schools, a competency certificate, and insurance certificate. because the process takes time and some travellers have already finished the process and will soon travel,” he said.
on october 2013, the government banned domestic workers from traveling abroad due to the rampant torture, sexual harassment and other civil rights violations endured by many ethiopians in saudi arabia, lebanon and other middle eastern countries.
after the ban was placed, the number of illegal brokers and undocumented migrants increased, causing a surge in the loss of life en route and at sea.
according to proclamation 923/2016 direct domestic worker employment is only for staff where the employers is an ethiopian mission or an international organization and where the job seeker acquires a job opportunity by their own accord in job positions other than house maid service.
receiving countries must protect the life and the disability insurance coverage rights of domestic workers. the proclamation requires domestic workers to have certificates proving that they have at least three months of training in their respective fields. agencies wishing to send workers abroad should have one million birr in capital to get the license. according to the bilateral agreement between saudi and the ethiopian government the minimum wage set for domestic worker for ethiopian workers is 1,000 saudi riyal."
"the central statics agency, which is responsible for counting the national population and number of houses, has finished preparing for the fourth national census from april 7 to 28.
the government of ethiopia established a commission, led by deputy prime minister demeke mekonnen and members from nine regional states along with ministers to spearhead the operation.
the census was initially scheduled for november 2017. it was then postponed again to march 2018 due to public unrest and violence in the country. the continued unrest caused further postponement until the current date was scheduled.
csa has prepared for the last couple of years and prioritized the use of technology to ensure quality timely results.
the csa had previously revealed the purchase of close to 180,000 tablets from chinese technology giants, huawei and lenovo, to effectively establish a meticulous data registration system, which will eventually avoid duplication and double counting during the data collection and registration process.
as the fourth phc is fully digitized, the agency is closely working with insa to protect against a possible cyber-attack, according to saffi gemedi communication director at the agency.
“ethiopia will be the reference for other african country as most of them plan to conduct their national censes by 2020,” collins opiyo technical advisor at unfpa told journalists.
in the census 85 questions are expected to be asked in one of five local languages: amharic, tigrigna, afaan oromo, somali, and afar.
for this censes around two thousand enumerators, supervisors and technical advisers will participate.
although the current fdre constitution dictates that the census be conducted every 10 years, ethiopia did its second and third population and housing census in 1994 and 2007.
following another controversy filled 2007 census, the results announced to the house of peoples’ representatives (hpr) was contentious at best. one was the error in counting the population in afar and somali regional states, which was later recounted. this particular error was, in fact, admitted by the commission at the time. the second was controversial because it potentially missed between 2 and e million members of the amhara population. after finishing the data gathering, the result will be announced within six months according to safi."
"the world justice project (wjp) released the wjp rule of law index 2019, an evaluation of rule of law adherence worldwide based on more than 120,000 household and 3,800 expert surveys in 126 countries.
featuring current, original data, the wjp rule of law index measures countries’ rule of law performance across eight factors: constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, open government, fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice, and criminal justice.
ethiopia’s overall rule of law score places it at 27 out of 30 countries in the sub-saharan african region, 18 out of 20 among low income countries, and 118 out of 126 countries and jurisdictions worldwide. significant trends included an improvement in “order and security.”
the top three overall performers in the wjp rule of law index 2019 were denmark, norway, and finland; the bottom three were the democratic republic of the congo, cambodia, and venezuela.
globally, the new wjp rule of law index scores show that more countries declined than improved in overall rule of law performance for a second year in a row, continuing a negative slide toward weaker rule of law around the world. in a sign suggesting rising authoritarianism, the factor score for “constraints on government powers” declined in more countries than any other factor worldwide over the last year (61 countries declined, 23 stayed the same, 29 improved).
“this slide in rule of law in general and checks on government powers in particular is deeply concerning,” said elizabeth andersen, executive director of the world justice project.
regionally, sub-saharan africa’s top performer in the index is namibia, 34th out of 126 countries globally, followed by mauritius and rwanda. the three countries with the lowest scores in the region were cameroon, mauritania, and the democratic republic of the congo.
the wjp rule of law index is the world’s leading source for original data on the rule of law. the index relies on more than 120,000 household and 3,800 expert surveys to measure how the rule of law is experienced and perceived in practical, everyday situations by the general public worldwide. performance is measured using 44 indicators across eight primary rule of law factors, each of which is scored and ranked globally and against regional and income peers: constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, open government, fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice, and criminal justice.
“effective rule of law is the foundation for communities of justice, opportunity, and peace,” said william h. neukom, wjp founder and ceo. “no country has achieved a perfect realization of the rule of law. the wjp rule of law index is intended to be a first step in setting benchmarks, informing reforms, stimulating programs, and deepening appreciation and understanding for the foundational importance of the rule of law.”"
"ten new roads in pipeline for addis 
the addis ababa city roads authority plans to complete 25 roads project and start 10 new ones this fiscal year.
the authority has spent over three billion birr to build and maintain the city road network and facilities.
“as part of the government’s existing trend, the authority is paying attention to completing the existing road projects on time,” moges tibebu the authority director general said.
many road projects were delayed because the contractors were not qualified, problems with consultants, design defaults and court cases connected to demarcation.
the authority is under discussion with the supreme court to set up speedy trial to alleviate the court cases in connection to demarcation which is the fundamental cause for the delay of most roads construction, the director adds.
the authority spends the money for the construction and maintenance of over 400km road networks in various part of the city including traffic and street lights, pedestrian roads.
asphalt road construction accounts for14.3 km. there are 36.9 km of gravel roads. there are 190km of cobble stone road projects, the highest share. there be 7.3 km of sidewalks built so to accommodate increasing foot traffic. the authorities long term game plan is to modernize and upgrade the road system.
according to moges tibebu, the authority’s director general, the projects are part of the city’s three year road master plan which was adopted in 2017. hopes are this will make traffic more efficient.
currently city road coverage is less than 20 percent which is below international standards.
“the authority plans to finalize five road projects before the end of this fiscal year,” moges added."
"esayas dagnew, former chief operation officer at the ethio telecom, has been charged with grave corruption and abuse of power for allegedly damaging the public interest in relation to a procurement made with zte for an ngpo project.
the same day, february 20, 2019, the federal supreme court dismissed an appeal by the police and upheld the lower court’s decision granting him 50,000-birr bail in another case.
police told the high court, that they suspected him of improper conduct in relation to a contract with us based consulting firm edm. investigators said the company obtained the deal without following the proper procurement procedure.
on february 13, esayas was freed on bail by the lower court. it was the second time this happened because on january 22 his bail was reversed by the supreme court reversed. police were then given ten more days to investigate the former ethio telecom official.
he was initially accused of awarding a purchase for the military complex, metals, and engineering corporation (metec), using his affiliation with his brother who was the former ceo of the metec, major general kinfe dagnew.
after the adjudicative court, the high court granted bail for the suspect at 200,000-birr but then police appealed to the appellate court.
the recent charge also listed a co-conspirator, who allegedly mismanaged the telecom’s procurement manual during the purchase of networking devices for universities.
he is suspected of concluding a contract with the chinese telecom multinational, zte, worth usd 44.5 million. and then illegally benefiting from the transaction.
the charge was read to him at the public trial which will be held at the 15th criminal bench of the lideta court this tuesday."
"alliance transport services s.c. has stopped providing public transportation services for commuters starting from february 5, 2019.
the board chairman of alliance transport service adil abdela told journalists that the disagreement with commercial bank of ethiopia (cbe) about the debt payment system for 100 buses that were purchased in 2015 was the reason they stopped.
the buses were purchased as part of a government initiative to solve the addis ababa city transport service problem. however, when the bank wanted the debt paid before the buses began operating it created difficulties. 
“the tariff set by the government has affected the company as our service is not determined by the market price,” adil added.
the 125 alliance buses transport ten thousand passengers, mostly in addis and its suburbs like sebeta, holeta, burayu, sululta, legetafo and bishoftu and different routes in the capital city.
the chairman apologized to customers for stopping the service without notifying people in advance, and hopes the problem is solved very soon as discussions are ongoing with cbe and the ministry of transport, adil said.
the company, which was established in 2009 and has 2, 500 shareholders with 35 million birr in paid-up capital, bought 25 buses, at a cost of 36 million birr, before tax, making alliance the first and only private city bus company to join the sector.
currently the buses are parked at the alliance transport services compound, in gulele district.
“the discussion with stake holders will be held next week in hopes transport service can soon be restored,” adil told capital."
"commodity trading for forex now showing empirical effect the trading performance of the ethiopian commodity exchange (ecx) improved over the first six months of the fiscal year even though the volume of traded goods was below expectations. their report, which covered the first six months of the fiscal year starting from july 8, 2017, showed that 256 thousand metric tons of three major crops; coffee, sesame seeds and pea beans, were traded, bringing in 14 billion birr.
the volume was 88 percent of their goal but the money taken in was 11 percent more than what ecx hoped for.
commodity prices have been skyrocketing in ethiopia.
“sesame seed prices are increasing the most but all commodities are getting more expensive at ecx, still this report is surprising because the volume was less than the target and the given the rates during this period the result should not look like this,” an expert said.
previously, the ministry of trade and industry accused traders of escalating commodity prices on the floor even though prices of crops like coffee declined or remained stagnant on the international market compared with a similar period last year.
recently, the ethiopian coffee and tea authority reported that the price of coffee on the new york coffee exchange declined. the authority’s report contrasts the half year monthly trading of the new york coffee exchange with the past budget year showing that the price declined significantly, during the current budget year. for instance, in july 2017 a ton of coffee was traded at usd 4,199, while it was usd 3,664 in july 2018 which is a 16 percent decrease.
on the international market on average in the last six months the price of coffee has declined from 24 percent to 9 percent compared with a similar period last year.
the major problem is exporters, often new to the business, who make their money by importing goods so they export commodities only to get foreign currency not to make a profit. for this reason they are willing to pay high prices for the commodities and then sell them at a loss so they can get hard currency for their imports. this messes up the market and leads to inflation.
to make things worse, according to the ministry of trade, now people are buying white pea beans outside ecx, which is illegal. according to experts, this could be one reason for the reduction in trading volume on the modern trading floor.
during the first six months, according to ecx, 255,763 tones of commodities were traded which is a decrease of 17 percent compared with a similar period last year, although this is not lower than the target. there were 129,993 tons of coffee, 99,147 tons of sesame seeds and 26,623 tons of pea beans traded on the floor.
receiving less commodities, preferring to hold on to crops because they are speculating that the prices will increase, and instability in some production areas are why ecx says the volume traded on the floor has gone down."
"the addis ababa revenue bureau has launched a tax campaign. the ceremony at the intercontinental hotel featured deputy mayor takele uma, federal and city officials, private businesses and the general public. the goal of the campaign is to increase revenue collection.
the mayor announced that after discussions with the city administration and the addis ababa chamber of commerce and sectoral association, they decided to lift half tax they were asking from 4,040 tax payers who were undergoing arbitration. this was due to claims that the tax imposed was exaggerated. during the 2016/17 budget year tens of thousands of level c tax payers had their taxes revised.
according to the addis ababa revenue bureau, about four thousand tax payers, owed half of the estimated tax dues. they were undergoing arbitration. however, now the city is considering exempting the balance and letting businesses pay half of their estimated dues.
another 1,070 businesses are either being sued or investigated by police for tax fraud. now the city is working to annul their charges and get them to settle the expected tax in an amicable manner.
still another group of businesses say they are unable to pay any tax. in this case the city will evaluate their activity and revise their tax.
thirteen thousand businesses in the city filed tax claims during the past budget year and 82 percent of those have been resolved."
"country earns 1.21bln usd for first half of 2018/19revenue from exports have continued to decrease as the country failed to hit its target for the first two quarters of the current fiscal year.
though the government planned to collect usd 1.96 billion for the period, it has only achieved about 62% of its target.
the minister of trade and industry, fetlework g. egziabher told members of parliament on thursday that the country earned export revenue of 1.21 billion usd in the past six months.
the revenue falls short of 750 million usd from government’s target for the period, which was usd 1.96 billion.
the minister, who presented her report to the parliament, indicated that the instability witnessed in some parts of the country has also contributed to the decline of export income.
the other reasons the minister mentioned is the failure of increasing productivity and reliance of raw agricultural commodities in addition to contraband border trade and lack of meaningful diversification of export items.
lack of inputs for the manufacturing companies, which often can’t get hard currency on time is also mentioned as are reason for the failure of the emerging manufacturing sector to generate export earnings.
while ethiopia’s export income has been declining, the country’s spending for imports has been growing, surpassing usd 17 billion last. as a result, of the growing trade deficit, ethiopia has been facing an acute shortage of foreign currency to import medicines and fuel.
the major export earning commodities of ethiopia include coffee, oil seeds such as sesame, flower, khat, fruits, vegetables, minerals and some manufactured goods.
the major hard currency consuming products ethiopia has been importing include fuel, different machines, medicines, steel, manufactured goods including foods as well as simple products such as, toothpicks, candies and cookies.
she also mentioned under-invoicing and absence of an export strategy as holding up the sector.
“the decrease of the revenue as well as its rate of decline have become very critical and needs careful consideration,” fetlework added."
"the ministry of trade and industry (moti) announced that it would review the licensing for exports to tackle illegal activity and establish a harmonized export business, in addition to stopping unethical people from abusing the sector.
misganu arega (amb), state minister of moti, told capital that the ministry will establish criteria for giving export licenses. “we have to review our way of giving licenses to exporters,” he added.
in the past the government claimed that the number of exporters was growing, but export earnings failed to grow significantly. the government says that some unethical people have become exporters with the intention of selling products below invoice to get foreign currency and then turn around and purchase items to import into the country in order to earn huge profits.
for instance, the number of agricultural exporters in the past budget year has grown from 546 to 9,396, but export revenue went down.
“one of the actions we will be reviewing is the licensing process. we will work with those who are mainly engaged in the export business and are not subsidizing another business,” he said.
“the traditional exporters working with established international brands who were employing people are leaving the profession because of these unethical practices so we will work to put a stop to this,” misganu explained.
recently moti accused exporters of escalating the price of export commodities at the ethiopian commodity exchange (ecx) while others were buying crops outside of ecx, which is illegal.
even though products like sesame seeds are sold for a high price at ecx people were selling the commodity at a lower price than the trading floor rate which moti claimed was under invoiced.
they also cautioned sesame seed and white pea bean exporters that they would prosecute them, while other ethical exporters complained that the government was not taking action. misganu told capital that his office is working prudently to take measures.
“we have secured relevant documents from ministry of revenue and the national bank of ethiopia to identify the contract, export volume and revenue of the exporters in the first three months of the budget year and then during the next three months as well,” misganu explained.
“regarding viewing the document we have identified those engaged in illegal activity,” he added.
“we want an ethical exporting regime so this has been affected by some illegal and irregular activities. we are cautious not to affect the country’s hard currency revenue. as a result, we are working carefully to undertake actions that are sustainable,” he explained.
“we never ignore prosecuting illegal actions,” he strongly stated.
“it may take some time since we are highly prudently but since we have been working on it the price has gone down at ecx and the export trend in terms of price is now improving,” he concluded."
"the federal housing corporation recently changed their rental prices, setting a floor of 509 birr per square meter at the shops and offices it rents.
now tenants are asking the corporation to revise its prices and lower the rent to 71.50 birr per square meter.
tenants made this argument at the meeting last wednesday at global hotel. they pointed to an eight year old study conducted by the corporation.
they argued that the corporation is not taking into account a realistic view of the economy and market. 
a woman who came from us doing business with her father in piassa said she will shut her shops if the corporation does not revise the new price.
“they asked us to pay 70,000 birr per month but we can’t make a profit at this price, for me it is not a problem. i can return to the us to work but what about the 43 workers who have built their lives on our company’s work,” she said.
other tenants said the corporation’s new price will aggravate rental prices of private shops across the city.
“after setting the new price some private shops in the city have started increasing rental prices which will ultimately hurt consumer’s pockets. the corporation should have looked at the impact of the new prices before they set them,” a young tenant said at the meeting
abrham arega who is the member of the tenants’ committee said the corporation set different prices on the same offices in a building which demonstrates that the price increases were not properly studied.
under the new revision 477 shops are set to pay 1,000 birr per month, 3,078 shops between 1,000 up to 2,000 birr, 447 shops between 20,000 to 30,000, three shops from 200,000 up to 300,000 birr and two buildings will pay 400,000 birr per month.
the corporation did not make any price revision for business shops in the last 40 years.
before the new revision 3,880 of the shops were paying 65 birr per square meter and 2,052 shops were paying below 10 birr for a square meter. surprisingly the rental fee of another 279 shops was below one birr per square meter.
the corporation recently announced that instead of applying their new rental prices at all at once, tenants will pay 35 percent of the new prices the first year, the second year they will pay 70 percent and the third year they will pay the full revised price."
"the organizers of the high level conference on taxation issues are disappointed by the absence of relevant government representatives in what is a priority agenda for the country.
the conference with the title: ‘challenges and solutions of taxation for promoting business related investment and four national building in ethiopia: politics, law and practices’ held on friday january 25 at sapphire addis hotel organized by afro-global consultancy services (ags), a recently formed organization to work on tax, finance and related issues, in collaboration with public and private organizations including the international bureau of fiscal documentation (ibfd), based in amsterdam.
during the full day event several papers focused on laws and policies of the taxation system, macro economics, fiscal, monetary policy, and identifying and tackling challenges that the country faces regarding taxes. it also featured inclusive panel discussions.
even though the high level event attracted several participants the organizers expressed their disappointment because of the absence of several top government officials.
fisseha-tsion menghistu (prof), president and ceo of ags, said that the expected individuals did not appear at the event, but the event is crucial and timely for the country.
fisseha-tsion, who has a half a century of experience in tax, investment and finance, said that the government should consider these kinds of issues to be a priority;
“i don’t want to accuse them for now but they need to give attention and support the sector for the future,” he told capital.
“the government needs to consult from ethiopian scholars with wide expertise, who are independent and working for their country. the government is expected to work closely with us,” he claimed.
he complained that the top officials at the government apparatuses do not know their future agenda. “some of them were willing to participate at our event but they have gone on other sudden meetings,” he added.
“the meeting that the prime minister strongly stated does not interfere with relevant day to day office work is not respected,” he criticized.
the conference mainly targeted to strengthen the effort and campaign of the ministry of finance and ministry of revenue to expand the tax collection.
during the last decade the country has registered double digit growth, but the tax to gdp ratio is still very low.
“the conference targets to discuss and analyze if tax collection challenges are related with political, policy, administration, law or implementation,” the founder of agc said.
“the aim of our consultancy firm is to give more support and to render high quality professional services to the government, the business communities, the ngos; finance and development institutions as well as to the general public,” the founder said. ags has ten phd level highly experienced professionals on micro economic policy, good governance, corporate responsibility, finance and other sectors.
“we organized this event not for profit, but with a goal of contributing to our country,” fisseha-tsion said.
“we did not get financial support from the government to host this event, which is supposed to be the responsibility of the government,” he added.
the country has a goal of expanding the tax to gdp ratio to reach 17 percent by the end of the coming fiscal year, while the actual achievement is very poor.
figures indicated that the country’s tax gdp ratio is lower than other regional countries and stands at about 12 percent and went down to 10.7 percent in the past year compared with the preceding year, which was below 13 percent.
the paper was presented on the day by dr. lemma gudissa stated that the reduction may be related with poor collection, updating the tax policy or the private sector.

"coffee, ethiopia’s leading export earning commodity, saw its export volume and value decline during the first half of the fiscal year. this reverses a trend that has taken place over the past few years.
the ethiopian coffee and tea authority’s (ecta) report indicated that the exported volume of coffee in the first six months of the budget year, which runs from july 8 to january 8, stood at 103,445 tons.
this is a decrease of over 28 thousand tons compared with the target. in terms of percentage the performance is about 78 percent of the target.
the report indicated that the volume has also shrunk by 4,194 tons or close to four percentage points when compared with the similar period of the 2017/18 budget year. during the stated period the authority planned for coffee exports to earn usd 475 million. instead they only brought in 70 percent of that amount or usd 334 million.
the revenue also declined when compared with the first six months of last year by usd 49 million or 12.5 percent.
in recent history, export earnings and volume would grow every year so this is unexpected.
november is part of the bean harvest season but that month experienced the lowest performance in both value and volume.
the authority’s six-month report which was 31 pages long indicated that the value earned in august met 87.5 percent of the target. during that same month, the volume was the highest, meeting 93 percent of the target. the november performance was 62 and 51 percentage points of the target by volume and value respectively.
saudi has stood as the top destination taking 21 percent of the total volume and 18 percent of the revenue, while germany followed at 16 and 14 percent of the shares by volume and value in the stated six months. japan took third place at 12 percent and the us, belgium, south korea, italy, sudan, australia and france were four through ten respectively.
the stated ten countries consumed 84 percent of ethiopian coffee in the past six months and contributed to 81 percent of the revenue from usd 334 million of total earnings. the report indicated that in the top ten destinations consumption has declined by four percent compared with a year ago and the revenue went down by 14 percent.
the us purchased 31 percent less coffee during this period which contributed to a decline in revenue by 29 percent.
the consumption of germany, which is also a hub of ethiopian coffee for the region and one of the top buyers of ethiopian coffee, went down by 25 percent of volume and 29 percent by revenue. volume exported to france has also declined by 18 percent which contributed to a value drop of 34 percent, while italy’s consumption also was reduced by three percent of volume and 17 percent in value.
the consumption of the other major destinations japan and saudi arabia, sudan, australia has increased significantly despite the revenue from saudi declining by four percent.
kerchanshe trading plc, tracon trading plc and adem kedir haji (hora trading) were the three top exporting companies respectively during the stated period. mulege, a prominent coffee exporter, abbahawa trading plc, oromia coffee farmers cooperative, sidama, coffee farmers union, arfasa trading, sa bageresh, and ethiopian trading business corporate ranked four through ten respectively on the top exporter’s list. in the past six months, 278 coffee exporters were engaged in the coffee export business, according to the report.
the ten exporters exported 40 thousand tons of coffee in total and earned usd 126 million which took up 39 percent and 38 percent of the share respectively from the total export and earnings for the period, while top 20 exporters have exported and earned over half of the total trading.
the report indicated that the top 20 exporters have contributed 54 percent of the value and volume of the total coffee business.
the minority, 64 percent or 178 exporters, took only 9 percent in volume and 8 percent of value. one of the challenges coffee is facing is the growing number of new exporters, attempting to get hard currency as opposed to trading it for traditional business reasons.
the new exporters have created confusion in the coffee sector and escalated the price of the product locally while exporting it at a lower price just to get foreign currency to feed their original importing business.
the well organized report of ecta has also compared the international coffee price with the first six months of the current budget year with the same period of the last budget year.
the table contrasts the half year monthly trading of the new york coffee exchange with the past budget year and it showed that the price has declined for the current budget year significantly.
for instance, in july 2017 a ton of coffee was traded at usd 4,199, while it was usd 3,664 in july 2018 which is a 16 percent decrease.
on the international market on average in the last six months the price of coffee has declined from 24 percent to 9 percent compared with the six months of the past budget year.
the authority, which also follows the spice sector also stated that in the first six months close to usd five million was secured from export which is half of the target.
the other product that ecta follows is tea. during the stated period, 984 tons of tea was exported and earned usd 1.6 million which is about half of the target."
"messele haile (phd), the founder of country club developers (ccd), appeared before the federal high court’s 6th civil bench on january 14, 2019. he was summoned to testify in a case regarding delayed homes that the court had previously ordered be finished.
messele told the court that he is trying his best to hand over the houses but that he needed three more months to finish installation work. messle’s excuse for the current delay is ordering material to complete the homes from abroad as a package deal along with many other items.
lawyers for the six plaintiffs refused the defendant’s request, stating that enough time had been given. they also demanded he be detained until he complies with the court order.
ccd was taken to the federal high court to execute a ruling given in their favor on january 1. in their initial agreement, the homes which lay on 1,000sqm, would be handed over within 18 months. after ten years of court battles the applicants accepted the final ruling and agreed amicably that the real estate company should deliver the houses within 16 months, granting 4 additional months for the import process. however the 16 months passed and then nine more months and still no homes appeared. so at that point the creditors applied to the court to force the execution.
ccd was also fined for failure to deliver the homes on time. they were ordered to pay 10 percent of the initial contract.
the applicants also sued for 30,000 birr for every month of delay in damages. this amounts to over one million birr.
the judge granted just one more month for the developer to hand over the homes. the case was adjourned until february 14."
"in jimma over 20 tons of butter and honey contaminated with added ingredients to lessen the cost has been seized.
ethiopia’s health minister, dr. amir aman made the statement during testimony to parliament.
the seizure came about as part of a joint action by professionals from the newly named food & drug administration authority (fdaa), jimma police and city residents.
fdaa is taking steps to stop the illegal activity by providing trainings on taking various measures to control such illegal acts by giving trainings on surveillance intelligence for professionals from federal and regional states to tackle the problem.
the tainted butter and honey was discovered at hassen garage and hibret school in the vicinity of jimma city. three people are suspected at this time.
the 21.5 tons of adulterated honey and butter is estimated to cost over two million birr, bekalu arega, fdaa representative in jimma told capital.
other items were found during the raid as well according to bekalu, including vaseline, petrol products, and sugar.
two of the suspects have been detained. legal proceedings have been filed at jimma city court.
lowering the quality of products by mixing them with other items has become a problem lately as people cut corners to get money. for example some businesspeople have been mixing injera or red pepper with sawdust.
fdda has the mandate to control food and medicine and enforce standards in healthcare institutions and health care professionals and control and follow up of hygiene and sanitation.
last week, in arada district, the addis ababa city police arrested people for mixing injera with impurities like sawdust and gypsum. over twenty barrels of adulterated dough and seven quintals of sawdust were seized during the raid."
"exporters are expressing their frustration with the ministry of trade and industry (moti), for failing to correct mistakes with marketing sesame seeds and white pea beans.
even though, moti was expected to take actions against illegal activity regarding sesame seeds and white pea beans, businesses have complained that the ministry has not taken any steps, and that this has affected the health of their trading.
early in december 2018 the ministry wrote a letter warning those trading the two crops illegally. officials of moti met twice with the crop traders a few days before the official letter and the second time about three weeks ago.
initially the ministry accused the illegal traders of trying to export sesame seeds under the price of purchase listed at the ethiopian commodity exchange (ecx). others are being accused of buying white pea beans at the primary market when it is supposed to only be traded at ecx.
the ministry says that the illegal activity affects the sector’s activity, other legal business and the country’s hard currency revenue in addition to affecting people exporting the crops at the price set at ecx.
exporters were expecting big changes because moti often said it would prosecute those trading the crops illegally. however, the ministry has not taken any action to improve the situation. as a result, the illegal activity is continuing and their businesses and reputations with international clients are suffering.
they say that the warnings issued by the ministry are insufficient and that tangible action must be taken to improve the sector.
three weeks ago, 95 people suspected of illegal trading met with misganu arega (amb), state minister of moti. he told them the ministry would begin taking legal action. they responded by begging for more time to turn the situation around.
“we have frequently insisted you stop the mal-operation but you haven’t so, now we have decided to take action against you,” misganu told exporters at a meeting held december 28, according to attendees.
“we assumed the case would be solved after that meeting on december 28 at the ministry hall, but so far we have not seen any changes,” exporters that capital interviewed said.
in november before the official warning letter officials at the ministry called a meeting of 95 business people involved in exporting sesame and white pea beans including the board of directors of the ethiopian pulses, oilseeds and the spices processors and exporters association (epospea) to consult and warn about illegal trading against ecx.
sources who attended the november meeting told capital that the officials have clearly indicated that the export price of sesame seeds are lower than the value that exporters purchased them from ecx and some of the exporters have suspended or defaulted the contract of their export. this is happening at a time when other exporting countries like sudan and nigeria are expanding their exports and boosting their production, according to sources who attended the meeting. the source adds that, moti officials say ethiopia is losing its major sesame seed market in china, which consumes 70 percent of ethiopia’s production.
the sector experts said that even though it is the peak season for sesame seed production like other export items traded at ecx the price has sharply increased every day. a pulses and oilseed trading consultant, who requested anonymity, also said that even though the price has gone up at ecx some of those exporters are exporting the seeds at a lower price than the rate that they paid at ecx. “this has confused the market,” he added.
the officials have told the exporters that they consider this to be under invoicing, which is illegal.
experts said that some new exporters are joining the export business in order to access hard currency, which is severely scarce, for their other business.
the officials also stated that there are exporters buying white pea beans outside of the trading floor. sources said that some of the exporters are engaged in buying the bean from primary markets like adama.
association sources recently told capital that the current move from the government is the right decision otherwise the sector will be crushed in the coming few weeks since most of the regular exporters are buying and selling the products in connection with a loan scheme from banks.
in a letter issued on monday december 3, and signed by mesfin abebe, crops marketing director at moti, stated that the ministry has been made aware of the latest illegal practices and that it would take action against those engaged in illegal activity, while exporters are expressing their frustration because the delay of the legal measure.
sesame seeds are the second largest export earner after coffee, while white pea beans are also the other major export product in ethiopia, which is still highly dependent on agricultural commodity exports. ethiopia is considered one of the two of big sesame producers and exporters in africa and up to fifth in the international market until recently but some african countries are now expanding their production and market."
"eleven people, including ermiyas t. amelga, have been charged with corruption at the federal high court’s lideta division bench under the file of m.g. kinfe dagnew. they are being accused of illegally procuring items. ermiyas is being accused of selling the imperial hotel to metec at an overvalued price.
as he appeared before the court ermiyas argued that it was unnecessary for the police to have more time to investigate the case. in fact, he argued, he did not need to be in custody because he voluntarily brought all the documents in question to the police, had been cooperating with investigators for a long time and was banned from leaving the country.
metec paid 75 million birr to ermiyas for the hotel in two instalments. metec bought the hotel from access real estate two years prior at a cost of 47 million birr from the family of afaw tefera.
prosecutors also charged ermiyas in another court case. at the 15th criminal bench he was charged along with 10 defendants including alem fitsum, owner of alem genet factory for allegedly causing 415.2 million birr in damages to the public interest through an irregular contract containing deceitful facts. he is being charged along with six alleged co-conspirators in this count.
on january 14, m.g. knife and 12 other individuals were charged for corruption in the purchase of two ships that prosecutors think cost the country 548 million birr. in addition b/g tena kurendi was charged with allegedly violating human rights."
"in an attempt to reduce crowding, special shops have been built for street vendors in addis ababa. however, now pedestrians are complaining that they are blocking the sidewalks and casing people to walk in the street.
during a recent tour of the city, capital observed new shops up and running in places like cherkos, kassanches, autobus terra, and sidist kilo and these shops were disrupting the pedestrian traffic flow. the shops are made out of plastic. they sell items like electronics, watches, sockets, electric wires and beverages like packed juices and soft drinks, clothing, and street foods like biscuits, chips, sweet candies snacks.
the addis ababa trade bureau randomly chose the sites for the shops to legalize the informal street vendors found throughout the city.
according to the trade bureau the shops were placed in such a manner so as not to affect movement of people and they will crack down on sellers blocking foot traffic.
however, some residents say not enough preparation was done before deciding on locations for the shops.
yohannes gobeze, 34 from arada sub city says there are already problems with increasing traffic accidents so if people are clogging the main roads by selling items, the problem will worsen.
according to the city’s traffic management agency, not all of the new shops are operating legally.
“the places have been selected by a small division of the administration (the werdas). we agreed that every shop must receive approval from the agency before they start working but honestly speaking a few shops brought a letter to us in an attempt to become legal after they had already opened, so we will discuss this with other agencies to solve this problem.’’
anecdotal evidence suggests the number of street vendors is increasing. the most recent study was in 2014, which showed an estimated 87,000 street vendors. however, there seems to be almost double that amount now as poverty leads people to use this as a means of survival and it takes up a higher and higher proportion of the informal economy."
"external challenges like the latest perk of us and china trade war, revised fdi policies besides slow interest of the international market is continuing bleeding local and foreign trade of the ethiopian leather industry.
the leather sector is one of the major historical sources of hard currency like coffee, while this day it has been substituted by other commodities like horticulture and khat.
the leather industry development institute (lidi) stated that the latest trade war between the two world’s biggest economies has affected the export of leather and leather goods.
berhanu sirjabo, public relations head of lidi said that the country’s export has been affected by the trade war between the us and china, who imposed tariffs on each other’s imports.
the public relations head claimed that the trade war affects the country’s revenue directly and indirectly. both sides would buy our products and export to each other’s country, but this has now slowed due to the tariff that both countries imposed on each other in the past few months.
experts at the ethiopian leather industries association (elia) said that the sector is going through a serious problem locally even though the international trend like the us china trade war is also pressuring the sector externally.
the leather sector actors are strongly arguing that the leather sector has declined in the past five years, despite the government’s statement that it has shown a slight improvement in investment and export revenue.
local tannery owners who requested anonymity claimed that the government has been deliberately or ignorantly affecting the sector through its policy which was amended in the past years.
“the sector has been built for nearly seventy years and was expected to brew better achievements in these days, but the reality is different,” they complained.
yared alemayehu, owner of wallia leather and leather products and former president of elia, said that the problem in the leather sector is very wide and directly pointed to the government’s policy.
“in the sector we the local actors have over a half century of experience, but all of a sudden in the past five years it has collapsed. it has to be asked why the collapse occurred,” yared said. “if the problem is seen in one or two factories it would likely be due to mismanagement by the companies but the problem is seen in all actors. therefore, the government body considers that it is a problem of mismanagement by local companies and lack of competition with fdis’ that invested in the sector around a decade ago,” he added.
that has caused stakeholders to develop incorrect policy in the sector and replace the former policy that only favor fdis, according to the sector actors.
“since the policy change is in favor of fdis there is another question, does the country benefit in export revenue, value addition, technology and even employment? but the answer is that the sector does not show any change regarding the stated questions,” yared told capital.
ethiopia’s rank in livestock population is 8th in the world while india is not far from ethiopia in terms of the population number of livestock but the export of india excluding local business has reached usd 17 billion. “when it comes to the ethiopian leather sector it did not show any change meanwhile the number of the size of fdis increased,” experts said when pondering the role of fdi and its contribution.
“when fdis expanded in the country why did the export revenue become stuck at the level where ethiopian actors performed about a decade ago,” they asked.
they argued that the current export revenue is not comparable from the performance a decade ago.
“ten years ago we exported natural leather, but now export items for instance footwear produced by synthetic materials is registered as the export of leather goods.”
“if excluding the non leather goods like the synthetic footwear and then comparing the leather export from exports ten years ago the current hard currency generation is lower than what we achieved years back,” they claimed.
“at the past we have earned the same export revenue by only the export of semi finished and finished leather not by exporting footwear. if they said that export of leather goods expanded why did the sector earn the same amount that we have contributed,” they asked.
in 2008 the government has imposed a high levy on the export of raw hide and skins and wet blue, pickle and crust, which are semi processed products to encourage the local production of finished leather and boost the country’s hard currency revenue.
against the investment proclamation of 2003 the government has allowed foreign investors to invest in the leather sector from scratch which was claimed as illegal and affects the local investors.
the 2003 investment proclamation stated that fdi shall invest from the semi processed; while the local investor is protected to produce from raw to crust on the concept the country has adequate capacity to process by local investors. “but without a law the government has allowed fdi’s to invest from the raw level that we argued it is a displacement of local investors,” experts claimed, “they even amended the investment proclamation that highly favors the fdi without evaluating the outcome of the allowed foreign investors in the sector.”
they argued that the government policy has affected one of the oldest businesses that ethiopian developed for close to 70 years.
“we have argued that the foreign investors do not have a long term vision and that they are now engaged on environmental challenges, lack of working safety,” they claimed.
currently about 16 local tanneries have suspended their production, however the government claimed that there are 8, according to sources. the sector has been one of the major areas to manage a huge amount of employees, but it declined.
experts also claimed that the other reason the sector did not show improvement in revenue is that the fdi’s export their products for their chained companies or affiliates by offering a lower price or under invoice.
“if the sector was protected on some level for local investors the customs shall cross check the cost of production of the finished and goods products, but when we challenged the idea allowing foreign investors to engage on all sectors the officials ridiculed us and blamed us saying that we are backward,” experts claimed.
according to berhanu, the limited capacity of ethiopian leather goods manufacturers regarding the management and weak technological capability also negatively affects the sector. “technological transfer on the sector is the major issue that the sector needs is tackling the inner challenge, while the external challenge is difficult to be solved,” berhanu said.
“when the technology advanced at the leather industries the sector shall keep the standard and improve the export value and volume,” he argued.
“the prime minister shall interfere and solve the problem by changing the policy,” local actors expressed hopefully.
experts at the association have also stated that the international trends in the past couple of years have changed in the leather sector.
currently the synthetic industry is booming and major manufacturers are also engaged in the sector that affects the ethiopian export.
“the sector is very dynamic which also is a significant factor in the slowdown of the ethiopian leather sector in the past couple of years,” sources at the association said.
according to berhanu the country has now a capacity to produce 20 million pairs of footwear per annum for the export market, while the revenue expected from the sector has not grown as per the expectation. “currently the country has a single factory that shall produce 50,000 pairs of footwear per day,” berhanu indicated. the country’s revenue from leather and leather goods exports stood at usd 134 million based on the past budget year’s performance.
at the end of the first growth and transformation plan (gtp i) the government has targeted to generate half a billion usd, while the actual performance did not show change for the past decade.
in the past few years the sector investment has grown significantly. for instance the number of tanneries has reached 32 from 20 about a decade ago, but some local tanning facilities became bankrupted, according to the sector actors.
“previously they have killed the local investors by buying the product with high price and now they are saying they do not want to use the local raw material that is the reason for price reduction and wastage of the national resource,” a tannery owner, who declined to be named, told capital. “currently we are very few struggling to service, while most of them are out of the market,” he said. “the companies that currently existing are also in trouble of heavy debt and even consumed significant amount of running cost in the past ten year,” he added, “if the government want the existence for the industry has to right off the debt of the companies what egypt made in the past.”
however even the number of tanneries increased more, in the past couple of years the raw material price has significantly dropped and that forced to waste the resource. to keep the resource from wastage the government itself is engaged on buying the raw hide and skin from suppliers on major holiday seasons and processed the raw to semi stage via private tanneries.
on the latest holiday, christmas, the raw hide and skin has been rated a price of up to 25 birr and 35 birr for goat and sheep skin respectively, while the demand of hide is very low that it has been sold by 4 birr per kilogram. the institute official said that lack of industrial salt has been slowed the hide trading on the holiday morning but it has been revived in the afternoon after the collectors encouraged to use edible salt as optional.
there are 24 footwear factories and from those 16 are engaged in the export market. the international trend indicated that the price of footwear is from usd 9 to 23, but the locally produced footwear is not worth more than usd 13."
"messele haile (phd), founder of the country club developers (ccd), has been summoned to court after people asked for his arrest.
the complainants appeared in court on january 1.
the plaintiffs had paid for six houses each resting on 1,000sqm of land and had been waiting for them over a ten year period. they then sued the real estate company and eventually the federal high court ruled in their favor. the court ordered the real estate company to deliver the houses in 16 months.
they were given four more months to complete the import process but still no house materialized. then, 5 months later the creditors went to the court to force the company to deliver the homes.
lawyers for ccd told the judge that they couldn’t deliver the houses on time because of the foreign currency shortage and the quality of products the company use for finishing materials.
the applicants wanted over one million birr in damages calculated at 30,000 birr every month of delay in getting the homes.
the applicants also reported to the court that they sent ccd three different letters notifying the company that it had failed to live up to its end of the bargain.
tamagn beyene, the lawyer for ccd said that it is illegal to arrest the general manager because he acted in good faith and forces beyond his control caused the company to be unable to finish the house."
"a new study is being conducted on compensation for people living alongside addis ababa’s rivers. the new plan, which would have to be approved by takele uma, vice mayor of addis ababa is expected to pay better compensation to people who live within a 50 meter radius of a nearby river and are forced to relocate. the current compensation system pays a minimum of 550,000 birr for private house owners. the new plan will only pay money to people who own a private house near the river while the people who live in government house will be relocated to a condo or keble home. sources in the city administration told capital that the new plan will be applied until the end of this fiscal year.“many people live near the rivers and we want to remove them quickly so, assuming the mayor approves we will revise our compensation plan.’’ recently the river basins & green areas agency made a plan to control waste that enters the rivers, and storm runoffs that cause flooding, and the creation of conducive institutional environments for conservation.a recent study made by the agency disclosed that 900,000 different government and private institutions are vulnerable to flood disaster.the identified 1, 435 places are at high risk and if action is not taken thousands could be killed and 4.2 billion birr worth of property damage could occur. among the riskiest places 66 are located near the river and 26 are located near a potential landslide area. most of the risky places are found in gullele and nifassilke sub city.riversides in addis ababa have been a source of worry for residents along their precipices. the areas have been dogged by landslides, pollution and lack of development for ages. but due to a spate of development activities, that might change soon.the research found that addis ababa rivers and riversides face problems which include: badly polluted segments through direct discharge of domestic waste generated mainly from households and institutions; river bank erosion; and inaccessible rivers and riversides."
"the office of the attorney general (oag) announced that it granted pardons to 503 individuals in recognition of the christmas holiday. the release was made by prioritizing women and elderly in addition to the other legal requirements. the office also announced that 13,122 certificates were issued for individuals who applied for amnesty issued by the parliament, excluding the beneficiaries form gambela, somali and afar regions because they had not sent the appropriate information yet. the proclamation is effective over six months beginning in july 20, 2018 and goes until january 21, 2019 so people can petition for pardons up during that time period. there are 13 crimes eligible for pardons. zinabu tule, the public relations director told journalists that their office is investigating clashes that have occurred throughout the country. hawassain hawassa prosecutors have filed charges against multiple people for instigating violence in clashes involving wolytia and sidama nationalities. in one case police presented evidence against 67 people suspected of contributing to fighting in hawassa prison. the suspects include one high official from the prison administration and five members of the police force, according to fekadu tsega, director at the oag. the charges are based on conflict between the wolyita and sidam nationalities in the prison. the second set of charges involves the former city mayor and 33 other people for leading violence which broke out in hawassa town. not every one of those 33 people are in custody as some have fled. there are 75 other people being charged with related crimes as well which fekadu says are still being investigated. burayuthe clash between the burayu and addis ababa youth is another event under investigation. police believe that the violence stemmed from fights which got out of control and then were flamed by rumors and innuendo. for example, fekadu talked about one false claim that made its way to broadcast media saying a little girl was killed and covered with the emblem of the oromo liberation front (olf). a woman spoke with the media and said she saw a little girl being raped and killed. this became a major instigator for violence between oromo and addis ababa youth. she later apologized saying that she made the claim because she thought it could have happened and she wanted to ‘inflate the activity’. according to the suspects under custody, they participated in violence because they saw their friends being beaten by the addis ababa youth when they tried to welcome their leaders to the capital city. the situation escalated when youth tried to paint an emblem on city roads, according to fekadu. with regards to the events in burayu town the attorney general pressed charges against 109 people, while 28 are still at large. three hundred and twenty one people were released because there was not enough evidence to try them. one of the difficulties in this case is that people traveled from addis ababa to fight in burayu and then left so it was hard to determine who was involved. there are at least four police included in the charges and one station commander from addis ababa. the head was charged as she and her colleagues were unable to prevent a child from being killed by a mob for wearing a t-shirt that had similar colors to the olf emblem. according to the update, there were about 37 individuals killed in burayu and 28 in addis ababa. two people were burnt beyond recognition. “political appointees and security forces actively participated in the violence,” said fekadu discussing places like burayu, hawassa, benishangul and others."
"the discharge of chemical waste from factories along the outskirts of addis, modjo, and adama are increasing the total dissolved solid (tds) amount of the awash river which is killing aquatic animal life and harming irrigation systems along the river. a recent study conducted by the environment, forest & climate change commission, ethiopia –(efccc) indicated that factories in addis, adama and modjo are the major pollutants of the river by discharging untreated chemicals and sewerage.tds is a measure of the dissolved combined content of all inorganic and organic substances present in a liquid in molecular, ionized or micro-granular suspended form.according to the study there is a high amount of tds around beseka lake which is a source of water for the awash river. the area around awash fountain, modjo river and adaitu are the places that are discharging a high amount of acid and salt into the river. because of the pollution, some farmers in afar are shifting their irrigation lands to escape the high amount of salty water from the river and some fish in the river are in danger because of the high amount of solid pollution in the awash river. hundaol gemechu, water pollution expert at efccc told capital that the factories have been warned to stop putting chemicals into the water but those warnings are often ignored. “a constant level of minerals in the water is necessary for aquatic life. changes in the amounts of dissolved solids can be harmful because the density of total dissolved solids determines the flow of water in and out of an organism’s cells. many of these dissolved solids contain chemicals, such as nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur, which are the building blocks of molecules for life.”“concentration of total dissolved solids that are too high or too low may limit the growth and may lead to the death of many aquatic organisms. high concentrations of total dissolved solids may reduce water clarity, which contributes to a decrease in photosynthesis and lead to an increase in water temperature. many aquatic organisms cannot survive in high temperatures. discharge of pollutants into rivers or any aquatic environment can change aquatic species diversity, abundance and ecosystems, due to their toxicity and accumulative behavior”.he added that over the last decade huge scale usage of chemicals in various human activities has grown very rapidly. the industrial and domestic effluents are released directly or indirectly into the large water bodies. awash river in eastern ethiopia, rises on a steep northern escarpment of the eastern (great) rift valley and is fed by lakes shala, abiyata, langano, and ziway. cotton is grown in the fertile awash river valley, and dams (notably the koka dam, 1960) supply hydroelectric power. herds of antelope and gazelle live in the awash national park. the river ends in a chain of salt lakes in the denakil plain, after a northeasterly course of about 750 miles (about 1,200 km)."
"new discussions are underway at the addis ababa city administration to resolve the issue of a confiscated g+4 project partially constructed by midroc. the city has decided to compensate midroc, which invested millions of birr in the building but stopped construction after it had built some ground pillars and floors. “when we compensate midoc we will consider the money they have spent while at the same time taking into account the wasted years of unsuccessful construction, if midroc had completed the building on time they would have earned money,” a source close to the issue said. according to the source a new g+4 building will be constructed. capital asked the source about the timing of construction, how the building would be used and when it would be finished. for the past two weeks the city has been partially using the land at piassa as a bus terminal for midi buses traveling to bole, mexico, saris and sar bet. when building construction begins the terminal will be relocated. “discussions are still ongoing when we reach agreement about the cost of the building we will use it as a government or business center,” the source said. some 20 years ago midroc received three hectares of land from the city to build a g+4 building. they partially did so but then changed the design and did not finish it. recently the addis ababa’s new deputy mayor, takele uma ordered the city land management bureau to confiscate 11 fenced plots of land owned by midroc and put them into the land bank. limited construction had been ongoing on those plots over the past two decades.the city had been criticized for allowing midroc to hold on to idle land for such a long time, and since they failed to start construction the government took the land and plans to re-sell it via tender.the fenced land in mexico square was planned for a business building. another plot next to the sheraton addis hotel was taken away from midroc even though they had paid 87 million birr to relocate people who lived on that land. the company says they plan to appeal. in total midroc lost 250,413 square meters of land."
"telecom, education transactions in question the attorney general’s economic & tax crimes directorate has pressed charges against the ethiopian branch of chinese multinational company zte (h.k.), and its two former general managers. at the federal first instance court lideta division, prosecutors argued that the company evaded income taxes, failed to pay value added tax (vat) and used illegal receipts. zte is alleged to have evaded 128.5 million birr in taxes between 2009 and 2012. during that time they earned 941.1 million birr from transactions. they also are being accused of failing to pay 28.8 million birr in vat collected from their customers. during four fiscal years of the company’s transactions, the former ethiopian revenues & customs authority (erca) which is now the ministry of revenue (mor) established 34 audit irregularities and demanded payment of 857 million birr. the company appealed to the tax appellate bench of the authority and started to pay after the amount was reduced to 412 million birr, last year. even though the company began making payments the former erca reported illegal activities to police who conducted further investigations. the company’s communication officer declined to comment on the matter or to say if the company paid the remaining amount on time. the investigation which involves, zte corporation, was related to its project contract with ethio telecom. the company was accused of abusing the duty-free privileges granted for projects worth billions of birr. in addition, its contractual relationships with the ministry of education have come under scrutiny and have irregularities which appear to be illegal.the prosecutors presented ten counts against the multinational company. they said the company and its affiliate zte corporation had various mobile network installations and related projects in the country starting from 2009 but they failed to declare some of their income and used illegal receipts to collect payments. the first count also alleged that the accused evaded income generated by providing trainings in ethiopia and internationally.in counts two through five prosecutors alleged that zte h.k. attempted to deceive tax authorities to get out of paying profit taxes by making phony receipts and claiming they made less money than they actually did. over four years they apparently took in 2.9 billion birr but failed to pay 28.8 billion birr in vat that they actually collected from customers. they would use illegal receipts to collect vat but would not send that money to the government coffers.the charges list two former people employed as general managers at the time the infractions occurred as second and third defendants. jiyang yung jun, who was the general manager of zte h.k. from december 28, 2006 up to january 16, 2009, and zan yan ming who served from january 16, 2009 up to november 22, 2012 are accused of failing to protect the company from committing crimes and using illegal documents. they are not in custody. responding to capitals inquiry, teka mehari, the company’s lawyer, said they hadn’t been served any court warrant and that he had no knowledge of any development in the case, other than the attorney general’s long lasting investigation into the mater."
"the government has expressed regret for the metal and engineering corporation’s (metec) involvement in the grand ethiopian renaissance dam (gerd), which has taken four years longer than anticipated and is currently experiencing delays. the project which began in 2011 was expected to be finished in 5 to 7 years or by 2017, according to the original plan and was supposed to be generating power even earlier. the civil work, managed by the italian firm salini impregilo, is progressing well even though some of their work has been derailed by metec’s electromechanical and hydraulic steel structure work which was supposed to be run in parallel but that has been significantly delayed. in a panel discussion held on december 13 at elilly international hotel seleshi bekele (phd), minister of water, irrigation and electricity, said that it was a mistake handing over part of the project to metec. metec was not experienced and was a new company when it took the electromechanical and other related work at the gerd. the officials at the ethiopian electric and ministry said that the major problem was lying about the performance.salini has concluded 82 percent of its part and secured the payment equivalent. at the same time metec has consumed 65 percent of the payment but has only finished 23 percent of the work.he criticized metec for relying on politics instead of professionalism. “this contributed to loss of the opportunity that the country would have earned if everything was run on time,” he said. “the civil work it better than the complex electrochemical work for new companies,” he expressed.“only 33 percent of the bottom has been finished and there are problems with quality and dimension but this section is supposed to be finished already,” kifle horo (eng), manager of gerd said.he said that several similar projects that are supposed to be accomplished face quality problems that will be dealt with soon.gerd is expected to be finished in 2022, and generation from two turbines will begin in two years.kifle said that some work being done by metec has been transferred to other companies which are supplying equipment like turbines and generators. well accepted international companies like alstom of france and voith of germany will be part of the installment process. the main problems involve lack of quality largely because metec created material and standard errors, significant delay, and was forced to make additional payments to correct the errors and claims by civil contracts, according to abraham belay (phd), ceo of ethiopian electric power (eep), which was supposed manage gerd directly and now has done so. seleshi criticized the exclusion of eep from the project. “the knowledge of eep was not transferred because it did not have a role in gerd, and instead only settled the required payment,” he said. “eep has massive experience, but in the gerd case it did not get involved,” seleshi said adding that; “institutional arrangements have been another challenge.”he said that eep has to own the project. officials declared that additional costs will be disclosed in the near future. so far the gerd has consumed 98 billion birr. initially the government stated it would consume usd 4.6 billion, which is around 129 billion birr given the current exchange rate. the officials expressed their hope that the public would continue to support the dam, which is fully financed by local sources, and still by gerd bonds.roman gebreselassie, director of the gerd council secretariat, said that from the total cost 20 percent was expected from the public contribution via different forms including the bond. she said that the public has already contributed 15 percent of the total expected contribution, while the latest reports regarding gerd has frozen the public’s resolve. “in our latest general survey 47 percent expressed disagreement for further financial support and the 45 percent are still hopeful about the flagship project,” she said. she underlined that gerd has to show improvements. kilfe, who replaced the late simegnew bekele (eng.) as a project manager, promised that they would never present fabricated reports about the performance of the project, which is now stuck at 65 percent from the previous 67 percent report. metec, which has most of its former leaders under custody on corruption charges, was well known for giving contradictory performance figures about its operation at gerd and other mega projects like sugar and fertilizer factories."
"the ethiopian association of basic metals and engineering industries (eabmei), wrote a letter to the prime minister and several relevant government officials opposing the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) directive. it has been also reported that the suppliers credit scheme is suspended.the association that represents 74 manufacturers in the specific heavy industry has claimed that the amended directive no. 47/2017 of nbe discriminates against local businesses. previously, nbe has amended the 2002 ‘external loan and suppliers’ credit directive’ in september 2017. the amended directive has added an article that allows foreign investors to access suppliers’ credit.the suppliers’ credit scheme has given extraordinary rights to foreign investors who ask for hard currency to import inputs, machines or spare parts without any precognitions imposed by the regulatory body on forex.those who have the right to use the suppliers’ credit scheme will be able to get foreign currency right away when they go to banks, while others including local investors, which are even invested on similar sector as foreigners, are expected to wait the line at the banks to get foreign currency on letter of credit (lc) scheme.this scheme has disappointed local investors because they claim that they are discriminated by a single directive of nbe. the directive they call ‘apartheid law’ is pushing local investors to leave the business and sell off to foreigners. some of them argue that the government has a policy to encourage the fdi that they supported but claimed that the law should give equal space to all investments.the eabmei’s letter issued on november 22 and sent to the industry standing committee at the parliament, pm office, deputy pm office, minister of finance, minister of trade and industry, governor of nbe, ethiopian investment commission, ethiopian chamber of commerce and sectoral association, metals industry development institute (midi) and members explained the effect observed in the sector.the letter that capital obtained stated that the member manufacturers are suffering from the shortage of hard currency, while it is a good decision that the government allowed the industry sector to support to access hard currency via suppliers’ credit to import required raw material and other accessories. however, they argue that “the directive article four stated only foreign investors can access the suppliers’ credit scheme against the discrimination of local investors, who are involved in the same investments as foreigners,” the letter t signed by solomon mulugeta, general manager of the association, reads.it elaborated that due to the directive allowing investors to secure hard currency without delay another challenge is imposed which dries up hard currency resources at banks, which indirectly affects the local investors who are unable to get hard currency via lc.mostly the credit on this scheme is settled by 180 days forcing banks to keep their foreign currency to settle import suppliers’ credit.banks have also complained that the suppliers’ credit directive put them underpressure. they recently told capital that the supplier’s credit scheme not only affects local investors but the financial institutions themselves because there is a default risk from their clients. most of the investors have acquired a huge amount of money as a loan and advances from banks, while currently due to lack of hard currency local investors complained that they are defaulting to because they cannot settle their debt on time. bankers say getting the letter of credit up front breaches the first come first serve directive of national bank of ethiopia.one of the prominent private bank presidents, who requested anonymity, told capital that initially the notion of the supplier’s credit indirectly forced the banks which applied without the consultation to settle the payment by the maturity date. “it has forced the banks to face a default risk which affects the country,” he said.“when the banks secure hard currency they focus on settling the credit rather than approving the lc for its other clients who are not included on the supplier’s credit scheme, which is also another effect on local investors,” bankers said.the four page letter that the association wrote to top government bodies stated that the nbe directive issued against the investment proclamation and amended in 2012. “the investment proclamation no. 769 defined the work ‘investor’ as both domestic and foreign, and article 36 of the same proclamation stated that ‘an investor who acquires an external loan shall have such loan registered with the national bank of ethiopia in accordance with the directive of the bank. both articles of the investment proclamation did not classified local and foreign investor,” it added.currently manufacturers not only on the metal and engineering sector but others engaged in import substitution claimed that their operations are not higher than 10 percent of the actual capacity.fite bekele, public relation of midi, which is the relevant government body following the metal sector, told capital that they are working under the government development strategy that promote the foreign investment but clearly stated empowering local investors is crucial. “we wanted foreign investors due to they come with new capital, knowledge and technology that local investors shall grab, while local investors are different since they are reinvest their dividend in the country in contrary foreign investors,” he said.he also shared the claim of the association and other domestic manufacturers. he reminded that his institute requested the national bank to get elaboration about the suppliers’ credit directive that excluded local investors. “we have written a letter to nbe on april 18, 2018 to get clarification about the directive which is against the investment proclamation,” fite said. he added that in the same letter copied to the then ministry of industry and relevant sector actors they asked the central bank leaders to facilitate a discussion with stakeholders. “however, we did not get any response for requests,” he told capital.sources said that in the past couple of weeks the central bank, which has given a support letter to investors for any of banks to get the suppliers credit, has suspended providing a permit for the import of items on credit. at the same time sources added that yinager dessie (phd), who recently was appointed to governnbe, ordered experts at the central bank to re-examine the directive, however capital was unable to confirm it from central bank.currently some of local manufacturers have halted their production and others are looking to sell their industries because they are unable to run at the usual production and face bankruptcy.recently, the national bank has amended its loan directive that gives some relief for lenders from foreclosures. investors appreciated amended loan directive that allows for more rescheduling for defaulted loans but they argued that the relaxed reschedule is not safe from interest increases. they insisted that the central bank should look for an amicable solution to give life for their business by providing access to hard currency.the amended directive ‘classification and provision directive no.ssb/69/2018’ issued two weeks ago by the regulatory body has given more iteration for short and medium term loans and gives specific rescheduling and extension rates for long term loans than the preceding directive, which was amended in 2008. the directive has also give bank’s own decision on the conditions on outstanding principal payments when they extend the payment system."
" imf recommends further devaluation of birr even though the tax to gdp ratio has gone down more than expected, the government is expected to introduce a new tax levy in addition to reforming the excise tax to boost the government revenue. the international monetary fund (imf) has recommended another devaluation of the birr and forex market flexibility. since the beginning of the first growth and transformation plan (gtp) the government has expressed its eagerness to expand the revenue from tax in line with the rate of the gdp. it has also show an improvement in the first gtp even though the rate is under the projection. at the heyday of tax collection in 2014/15, which was the end of gtp i, the revenue authority body which at the time was the ethiopian revenue and customs authority, collected 12.7 percent of the dgp. this is lower than peer economies and countries in the east africa region.however the tax collection has not risen in proportion to the growing gdp. for instance, in the 2016/17 budget year the tax collection stood at 11.6 percent of the gdp. according to the latest report of the imf it has went down more in the previous fiscal year and is now 11.1 percent less than the preceding period, which is very far from the target of 17 percent at the end of the current gtp, which will end in the coming budget year. the imf forecast indicated that in the current and the coming budget year the tax gdp ratio will stand at 11.2 and 11.3 percent which indicates that the government will never attain its target of over 17 percent in 2020. in its article iv consultation the imf usually recommends that expand its tax revenue to widen the public expenditure coverage from tax. the latest imf report, which is the final of preliminary reports issued in september this year, stated that ethiopia has made progress in mobilizing domestic revenue since the mid-1990s, but still lags countries in the region and other low income countries (lics). “the tax-to-gdp ratio rose from 8.6 percent in 2008/09 to 12.7 percent in 2014/15, but it has declined since then to 11.1 percent in 2017/18,” it said. in the past budget year the government has targeted collecting 200 billion birr, but the actual performance was actually ¼ of the target, which is a significant reduction compared with the recent trend in the tax collation and target achievement ratio.“ethiopia relies heavily on trade taxes, while direct and indirect taxes have underperformed. direct and indirect tax revenue was 56 percent of total revenue in ethiopia in 2016/17, below the 64 percent average for lics. trade tax revenue, at 26 percent of total, is substantially above peers, while non-tax revenue plays a small role in domestic revenue,” it added.ethiopia lags behind regional peers on vat and cit (corporate income tax) efficiency measures-a key reason for the low tax-to-gdp ratio, according to the imf consultation report.“on revenue mobilization, the authorities intend to redouble their efforts, with support from donors, including the fund, to strengthen revenue administration and were also considering revenue-enhancing tax policy measures-such as excise reforms,” it added.it has added that the government goal of addressing the decline in tax revenues through a comprehensive tax transformation program (ttp) that has directly followed by the prime minister and undertaken a consultant and a task force under ministry of finance to improve the tax system and revenue via a browed tax system. the ttp focuses on taxpayer registration, e-filing and digitalized self-assessment, compliance risk management, tax arrears management, and federal regional tax coordination with assistance from the fund and other development partners.“consistent with fund advice, the authorities are conducting a cost-benefit analysis of existing tax expenditures with a view to their rationalization,” it said. in addition, the authorities could implement reforms in excises and introduce a property tax, thus generating additional fiscal space. currently the government has imposed from 10 to 100 percent in excises tax on 19 different types of products. however the property tax would be new for the country if it becomes effective. source at ministry of finance told capital that initially property tax has been studied by ministry of urban development and construction. “because it is not the mandate of the urban development ministry we have now taken it to study under our jurisdiction,” a source, who is in the legal department at ministry of finance said. the urban finance strategy of ministry of urban has been included the revenue collection from property in towns that is now revised by ministry of finance, according to sources. currently individuals are focused on buying houses, which are not taxed, they then invest their capital in other businesses. property tax has targeted discouraging those who focus on expanding property ownership in addition to expanding government revenue, according to sources. property taxation is common in other countries. for instance the majority of african states have a property tax system. monetary and financial sector policies recommendationin its latest report imf under its monetary and financial sector policies recommendation gives the usual suggestion for more devaluation, despite that the government applied a 15 percent devaluation on the birr against major hard currencies in october 2017. imf stated that the tighter fiscal and monetary policy stances, coupled with a more flexible exchange rate, would support external competitiveness. “the competitiveness boost from the october 2017 devaluation has since been largely eroded. the birr was kept constant relative to the us dollar while the latter appreciated against major currencies; and ethiopia’s inflation differential relative to trading partners has stayed high,” the report explained. “as a result, staff assesses that the external position is weaker than medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings would imply, and the real effective exchange rate was overvalued by 12–18 percent as of september 2018 only a modest improvement since last year’s assessment,” it added. according to the imf, more recently, the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) has resumed its previous policy of gradual nominal depreciation against the us dollar. it added that a more flexible exchange rate aimed at eliminating misalignments and building up reserves would help competitiveness and foster stability, while reducing foreign exchange shortages.the report believed that a more flexible exchange rate policy aimed at reducing the real overvaluation of the birr, reducing foreign exchange shortages, and accumulating reserves would help to improve competitiveness.the report stated that the more restrictive monetary base targets and public sector credit policies, including tighter nbe deficit financing, will help bring down inflation. “these policies need to be complemented by a more flexible exchange rate policy aimed at correcting the birr overvaluation, improving reserve coverage and reducing foreign exchange shortages, as well as by the development of financial instruments with market-based interest rates and other financial development measures, as discussed below,” it added.the country debt has also grown compared with the past year by close to 4 percent. a year ago the debt ratio compared with gdp has stood at 57.2 percent, while in 2017/18 fiscal year it grew to 61 percent. from the total debt domestic debt has increased by one percent and stood at 28.8 percent. the external debt was 32.3 percent in 2017/18, and was 29.4 percent in 2016/17.according to the government, due to the growing debt stress in the current 2018/19 budget year, no new projects will be allowed to rely on non-concessional financing, and ongoing projects will largely shift to concessional financing. imf stated that the debt sustainability assessment (dsa) shows that ethiopia remains at high risk of debt distress because of its small export base. public and publicly-guaranteed external debt breaches the thresholds for the present value of debt-to-exports and debt service-to-exports in the baseline. debt service payments are expected to increase in the coming years, as grace periods on non-concessional debt acquired in the past expire. regarding real gdp growth activity will be supported by continued growth in manufacturing and services, particularly expansion of air transportation, while construction may remain subdued due to restrictive public policies, according to the imf.based on current policy settings, medium-term economic growth is envisaged to converge to around 7 percent, supported by rising fdi, continuing investment in infrastructure by the public sector, and rising productivity levels as export-oriented industries take root and start operations.the imf report forecasts that fdi and remittance growth are expected to resume as political uncertainties settle following the leadership transition. “external financing constraints will temporarily ease in 2018/19, owing also to the recent usd 1 billion deposit from the uae and a usd 1.2 billion world bank development policy financing (dpf) operation. as a result, international reserves are expected to reach usd 3.4 billion (1.8 months of prospective imports) in june 2019 consistent with the authorities’ projections. according to the report as of the end of the past fiscal year the country’s reserve stands at usd 2.8 billion of imports of goods and nonfactor services of only 1.6 months (the government stated that it was a 2.1 months) that supposed to be at least 3 months. in the 2016/17 fiscal year the reserve was usd 3.19 billion or importation for two months. according to the imf, foreign reserves have increased to usd 3.7 billion in september, following the receipt of a usd 1 billion deposit from the abu dhabi fund for development (adfd) in nbe in july. however, foreign exchange shortages persist, as evidenced by the spread between the official and parallel market exchange rates and the long wait times for businesses to obtain foreign exchange.in the monetary and finical sector policy the imf stated that the nbe’s stance of containing reserve money growth to 13.3 percent in 2018/19 is a welcome step to bring inflation to target but will need to be complemented by other policy measures. in recent years, the growth rates of reserve money and of broader credit and monetary aggregates have diverged. this signals that reserve money may be losing its effectiveness as a monetary policy instrument a natural transition as the financial system deepens and becomes more sophisticated. “hence, the base money target needs to be complemented with policies to contain credit growth, especially to the broad public sector,” imf recommended. beyond the immediate term, however, the nbe’s intention to develop market-based indirect monetary instruments will necessitate the creation of a market for government debt with market-determined interest rates, according to imf.it added that ministry of finance could issue specially designed marketable securities in gradually increasing volumes to finance the budget, which could be held and transacted by banks and other appropriate institutions. in turn, the nbe would use interventions in this market to signal its interest rate stance, helping to better control broad money and credit growth. issuance of these budget-financing securities would allow the gradual phasing out of nbe financing of the government.since the commencement imf opposed the implementation of nbe bills that forced banks to buy 27 percent of every loan with a five year maturity and 5 percent interest rate, which was 3 percent before october 2017. in its latest report it has also recommended the reform of nbe bills in addition to discontinuing the funding of the policy bank, development bank of ethiopia (dbe), the cash collected from private banks on nbe bills.“these 5-year nbe bills must now be purchased by private commercial banks in an amount equivalent to 27 percent of gross credit extended, irrespective of the maturity of the loans-about 75 percent of these funds are then used to fund the dbe, whose npl ratio has steadily increased to 39 percent,” it said. it said that nbe bills now represent 30–40 percent of private commercial banks’ loans outstanding, and although the interest rate on them was recently increased, it remains negative in real terms. “the bills have been successful in reducing banks’ excess liquidity, but their design should be improved to better serve this purpose until a t-bills market develops-by reducing their maturity and possibly basing the purchase obligation on excess reserves,” it said. “further funding of the dbe by the nbe should be discontinued, at least until the ongoing comprehensive assessment of its financial situation is completed and resolution measures are implemented,” it added the imf report has indicated that the country gdp at current market price stood at 2.138 trillion birr in 2017/18 fiscal year; a year ago it was 1.807 trillion birr."
"the ministry of trade and industry (moti) is accusing oilseed and pulses exporters of illegal activities associated with foreign trade because they allegedly traded sesame seeds and white pea beans outside the ethiopian commodity exchange (ecx). two weeks ago officials at the ministry called a meeting of 95 business people involved in exporting sesame and white pea beans including the board of directors of ethiopian pulses, oilseeds and the spices processors and exporters association (epospea) to consult and warn about the illegal activity in illegal trading against ecx.sources in the sector told capital that the officials have clearly indicated that the export price of sesame seeds are lower than the value that exporters purchased them from ecx and some of the exporters have suspended their export. this is happening at a time when other exporting countries like sudan and nigeria are expanding their exports and boosting their production, according to sources who attended the meeting. the source adds that, moti officials say ethiopia is losing its major sesame seed market in china, which consumes 70 percent of ethiopia’s production.the sector experts said that even though it is the peak season for sesame seed production like other export items traded at ecx the price has sharply increased every day. a pulse and oilseed trading consultant, who requested anonymity also said that even though the price has gone up at ecx some of those exporters are exporting the seeds at lower price than the rate that they paid at ecx. “this has confused the market,” he added.“for instance, even though the exporter paid usd 1,750 per ton of sesame seeds during trading at ecx it will sell it for usd 1,500. this trend has affected the export oriented businesses,” he explained.ministry officials are warning the illegal traders that they are only harming themselves. “both your business and the country are losing due to your practices,” the officials said. they have told the exporters that they consider this to be under invoicing, which is illegal. experts said that some new exporters are joining the export business in order to access hard currency, which is severely scarce, for their other business. the latest trend is also seen by some of the manufacturers who are unable to get foreign currency from banks unless they are engaged in export business. according to experts they are told by banks to engage in an export business to access foreign currency which affects the export business. “manufacturers are engaging in the export to get relief from their daily work and settlement of bank loans and labor costs since it is their ultimate goal, but it has affected the country’s hard currency earning and business owners,” experts said. in the meeting at moti, the officials also stated that there are exporters buying white pea beans outside of the trading floor. sources said that some of the exporters are engaged in buying the bean from primary markets like adama.sources said that even though moti officials warned those illegal actors nothing has changed so the ministry has written a warning letter to exporters via their association.association sources said that the current move from the government is the right decision otherwise the sector will be crushed in the coming few weeks since most of the regular exporters are buying and selling the products in connection with a loan scheme from banks.the letter issued on monday december 3, and signed by mesfin abebe, crops marketing directorate director at moti, stated that the ministry has been made aware of the latest illegal practices at the sector.the letter that capital obtained stated that the ministry will take action against those engaged in illegal activity. according to the sector actors, engaging in exporting sesame seeds, which is the second largest hard currency source after coffee, is not difficult for new comers since the seeds are well accepted by major destinations in asia. a few years ago ethiopia was one of the top sesame seed exporters in africa and listed as one of the top five in the seed production and trade in the world. the latest data indicated that new countries like tanzania and nigeria have expanded their production more than ethiopia. china, india and myanmar are major producers but they are also large consumers."
"after being unable to relocate 43 houses siting in the old sheik khojale palace, located near st. rafael church, people are challenging the addis ababa cultural and tourism bureau and asking it to renew this old palace which was constructed 112 years ago. the palace which lies on 1,800 square meters is currently in a dangerous situation. some of the walls of the two g+1 story buildings have been cracking because there has not been repairs or maintenance done on the palace. initially there were three buildings in the palace, but one of the buildings was demolished some decades ago because people who lived nearby were careless. among the 43 houses found in the palace, 13 of them were constructed illegally, and the others are kebele houses where the residents pay a small monthly fee to the government. there is also a public school located there. in the last fiscal year the cultural bureau paid 2.4 million birr to a local consulting company to study the renovation of three historical houses found in the city including the sheik khojale palace.but the gulelle sub city who is in confusion to give relocation house for the illegal houses is slowing the renovation study of the palace. dereje seyum, heritage expert at the cultural bureau told capital that unless the houses are fully relocated to another place the study can’t proceed and thus an answer as to how to reconstruct the palace can’t be given. “the study should have been completed last year and reconstruction works should have strated this fiscal year but people are living in the houses and we can’t conduct a study in this situation. we have written letters many times to the concerned body to relocate the houses but no action has been done so far to help our work. relocating the houses is not our mandate and we will wait till the houses are fully removed from the palace to carry out our study’’ dereje said.according to dereje the palace will be a museum or an art gallery. sheik khojale was governor of assosa in the times of minelik ii. khojale hassan as governor of the whole territory of benishangul and began ruling by incorporating the domains of the two local muslim leaders; khomasa and benishangul. in 1925, during the regency of ras teferi, khojale was summoned to addis ababa because leaders of the central government wanted him to ensure his allegiance to them sheik khojale of benishangul tried to coordinate his people to resist the fascist italian forces.sheik khojale had initially submitted to italians and tried to maintain his power by showing his allegiance to the conquering force. but once the italians made it clear that they had no intention of ruling the country with involvement of ethiopian nobles, khojale changed his mind and began to resist the italians."
"a new study conducted by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations dubbed ‘report on feed inventory and feed balance in ethiopia,’ indicated that over the last five years prices of feed supplements for animals has risen over 41 percent. the prices of vitamin premixes and methionine remained relatively stable as compared to the trends in prices of minerals, lysine and salt. the high price of feed ingredients and compound feeds and the shortage and very high prices of feed ingredients are key challenges for sustainable and affordable delivery of compound feeds. prices of feed ingredients and compound feeds have increased by an average of 52 and 82 percent respectively leading to low demand of compound feeds. this situation has even led to closing of some commercial farms (dairy and beef), essentially due to low returns on the investment.most private and farmers union feed processing plants are currently facing serious challenges in analytical services mainly because of high cost and inadequate service delivery.the study also indicated that there are no well-equipped and accredited labs to satisfy the commercial feed sector.domestic production of supplements and feed additives are in their infancy and thecountry’s requirement heavily depends on imports, demanding technical and policy interventions. the prices of feed ingredients and compound feeds have increased at an alarming rate. seyum aman, an expert in poultry told capital that feed stakeholders should come up with a new strategy to engage in commercial farming.“there are simple things that can be done like using waste from beer companies for animal feed but it is not well known here and the other problem is there is not much coordination between agriculture farming and husbandry so they lack efficiency to work with each other in a proper system.’’dr terzu dey, director, veterinary drug and animal feed administration and control authority said that there should be many entrepreneurs to fill the high demand and supply gap of animal feed.“as a country we have only 18 companies who work on animal feed production and with such a small number we cannot address our issue, we must attract new business people to work in this area. there is also not land here which is only for animal feed production.” currently a total of 81 enterprises under 5 major categories are operating in the ethiopian commercial feed sub-sector.the dominant enterprises are feed processing plants owned by private companies and farmers unions engaged in production of compound feed followed by importers or manufactures of supplements and of feed processing machines and suppliers of forage seeds.a total of 32 privately owned feed processing plants are currently operational. in terms of geographic distribution, most of the enterprises are located in oromia and addis ababa regions with respective contribution of 37 and 31 percent."
"the association of ethiopian insurers is going to assign another actuarial firm to find solutions to improve the insurance industry, primarily by suggesting ways to lessen the blow caused by the high amount of motor vehicle accident claims. they are negotiating with a new company after a kenyan company failed to come up with a satisfactory result.
the association of ethiopian insurers had assigned an actuarial firm to undertake a detailed study after the financial regulatory body national bank of ethiopia (nbe) advised insurance firms to find solutions to the problem.
ethiopian insurers have frequently complained that motor insurance has slashed their profits due to unfair competition.
car insurance has been a common problem for the profession. insurers say the premiums they charge are small when compared with the damage. from the total claims insurers settle every year motor vehicles make up the largest proportion. in their annual report they expressed concern about the growing risk of auto insurance.
meanwhile insurance firms say that low premiums promote unfair competition and negatively affect their business.
experts said that the current competition between insurance companies is not based on the service that they provide instead they are pulling the rug from out each other in a race to the bottom by trying to offer the lowest premium payments. experts said that even though they expressed their concern and agreed to increase premiums during their meeting, nothing happened. “it backfired and this affects them,” an expert explained.
since nbe made the recommendation in early 2017 insurers have come with concrete solutions via their association. then they assigned kenyan based actuarial services (east africa) limited (actserv) to undertake a detailed study and come up with possible solutions.
however, the kenyan company assigned to undertake the study did not come up with a satisfactory preliminary result, according to hadush hintsay, secretary general of the association.
he claimed that the actuarial firm did not meet the expectations of the association. “it is new for us and at the same time their output did not match what we expected from their profile,” hadush told capital.
the kenyan company was expected to finish the study within a few months but the preliminary study took over a year.
“initially we were not ready to provide organized information from some of the insurers which delayed the operation,” he said. the study needs to evaluate the activity of every insurance firm including the premium estimate, income, and expense and management experience of the financial firms.
the secretary general said that they never paid a penny to the kenyan firm.
according to hadush, currently the association is in negotiations with another foreign actuarial firm to undertake the study.
“based on our experience before during the previous actuarial study we were not prepared to provide sufficient information for the company to finish the study within a few periods,” he said.
“so far our current negotiations are positive but we don’t want to mention the name of the firm since we have not concluded the negotiation,” he said. it is a foreign company, he added, because there is not this kind of consultancy firm in ethiopia.
the study is expected to show ways of alleviating the problem. experts said that it one possibility is setting a minimum premium rate for different products.
hadush said that even though the document will be submitted to nbe, who is responsible for ratifying laws for insurance companies, the study will also help ethiopian insurance companies because the current insurance business in ethiopia has not been studied by an actuary.
“the study will be a scientific justification for the insurance business,” he added. the actuarial study will also include other general insurance topics.
a year ago the sector leader told capital that the experience of others is related to the minimum premium rate. “for instance in kenya the minimum insurance premium amount for motor vehicle insurance is set to three percent of the value of the vehicles but the actual premium amount has grown to 5 percent since the car compensation has risen,” the expert said.
in ethiopia the premium percentage in the motor sector has been declining due to unfair competition reaching less than one percent of the value.
but the amount insurers compensate has grown significantly every year. sometimes the motor claim is covered by the premium collected from other policies, according to experts.
besides the fatalities and other human damage traffic accidents are bleeding the country’s economy and escalating the shortage of hard currency.
traffic accidents along the djibouti corridor damage imported products, while maintenance for vehicles requires spare parts imported with foreign currency.
“on the other hand the higher compensation from insurance companies has affected the revenue not only of shareholders but the general public as a whole,” an expert added.
since the minimum premium was set insurance companies will have better revenue so they can invest more in saving expenses from vehicle accidents as issuers do in other countries.
“in other countries insurers take part in road designs, and even the production of vehicles which reduces traffic accidents,” one industry insider said. “we can engage in such kind of involvement to tackle the problem,” they added.
besides the motor sector the insurance premiums for project insurance decreased in the past few years, according to experts, for example a few years ago project premiums were about 0.4 to 0.5 percent but now they are less than 0.1 percent."
"the ministry of revenue (mor) announced that it would conduct a risk-based audit of over 3,089 business during the current fiscal year. about 2,179 companies will undergo a risk-based tax audit which is a significant increase from previous years.
“because there are many uncollected taxes in ethiopia the audit gap is expected to rise parallel to our auditing capacity,” said zeru gebru a director at the ministry. “we have about 450 auditors and based on our performance audits are going to increase.”
the ministry uses 22 parameters to determine risk. some major red flags that will bring about an audit include consistently declaring loss or an ongoing loss or listing many unnecessary expenses. known as cost aggravation, this is many done by construction contractors who often have declared purchases that do not actually exist.
another huge red flag is when the assets and debts are out of proportion. if debts keep increasing and assets keep declining the ministry is likely to investigate for illicit activities.
desk audits will be conducted on companies listed as medium risks. these are conducted over a few days by going through documents published by the taxpayer.
another problem frequently found in the construction sector is bulging costs, when companies who frequently make large profits make many purchases which can then be inflated illegally.
“we will trace if the cost is real or not only by conducting the appropriate audits,” said zeru.
the large taxpayers’ office (lto) is conducting its risk-based audit of its 272 taxpayers who have entered into a high-risk zone based on the 22 parameters. the branch office currently has 770 taxpayers after the government decided to take the public enterprises out of the branch office last year.
among the total risk-based audits plan by the lto 46 of them are companies working in the import and export area. the office which consults the companies on the high-risk existence in the sector the 172 importers and exporters participated and raised their issues to the ministry. erca faced 10billion birr revenue gap for the quarter
in its quarterly report, the ministry announced that the collected revenue was 3.21 billion birr lower than planned. revenue to be collected from the inland tax was aimed to be 28.8 billion birr. however, this was declared to be 7 billion birr, compared to collectable customs duties which raised the total revenue uncollected to 10.72 billion birr, according to netsanet abera, deputy director at the authority.
“the decline in revenue is lower than the same period last fiscal year,” netsanet told journalists. “we are hoping the gap will be filled with the current month’s revenue collection when 90percent of the tax payers will pay their annual taxes.”"
"even though they are a new player in the financial industry young berhan bank (bb) has continued growing despite a slight reduction in profits. bb has amassed 1.5 billion birr total income for the year which is an increase of 36 percent. as usual interest is responsible for most of their income. the financial statement indicated that the interest income has expanded by 60.5 percent compared with a similar period a year ago reaching 1.1 billion birr.
bb claimed that their profits had gone down somewhat because of the country’s socio-economic situation which has put pressure on the entire banking industry. according bb’s statement in the 2017/18 financial year the bank earned 410 million birr profit before tax, which is a slight decrease from last period’s 428 million birr.
the profit without tax and other expenses stands at 311 million which was 316 million birr a year ago. the earnings per share also declined decrement compared with the 2016/17 performance. according to the annual report the earnings per share was 20.4 percent, which means it was 30 percent per 1,000 birr share.
on the other hand the bank’s assets reached 14.1 billion birr, which is an increase of 33.5 percent compared with the preceding year’s 20.5 billion birr.
for the year berhan’s capital strength continued significantly. in 2017/18 the total capital increased nearly 20 percent or one fifth compared with the 2016/17 fiscal year.
according to the report, the bank’s total capital has reached 2.2 billion birr with a paid up capital of 1.7 billion birr, which is an increase of 22.4 percent.
in terms of deposit mobilization the bank was able to collect almost 11 billion birr which is a growth of 41.6 percent compared with a year ago.
from the deposit mobilization, savings took a share of 53.1 percent followed by demand deposits. one of the achievements for deposit mobilization is the expansion of branches and services which has led to a 43 percent increase of depositors that has reached 523 thousand.
the bank’s outstanding loan performance has been stood at 7.2 billion birr and grown by 33 percent. the weak economic condition and export performance has affected the bank’s international banking activity.
with regards to international banking bb mobilized usd 108.5 million, which is a 13 percent decrease compared with the 2016/17 financial year."
"the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) is evaluating the amended directive fxd/47/2017 which addresses external loans and supplier’s credit, capital learned.
the directive amended the 2002 ‘external loan and supplier’s credit directive no. ref/05/2002’ which allowed foreign investors to access foreign commodity credit with a guarantee from local commercial banks. the law was applied as of october 2017. it has been criticized by local investors engaged in import substitution and heavy industries. the financial leaders and experts have also expressed their concern that it may pressure them to settle the credit as opposed to allocating foreign currency on a letter of credit basis. at the same time banks expressed anxiety that they would be unable to collect their money from manufacturers who received large loans. in the past two years the hard currency shortage has forced manufacturers to shrink their production or stop it altogether.
experts are arguing that the directive goes against the investment proclamation.
legal experts argued that the 769/2012 investment proclamation erroneously mentioned on the central bank directive fxd/47/2017 as ‘679/2012’ on its part one article 2/4 stated that investor means a domestic or a foreign investor that invested in ethiopia.
“the proclamation indicated that it has not divided local and foreign investors in relation to acquiring external loans,” a business consultant said, “but they claim the central bank directive went against it.”
“this is an apartheid law that only benefits foreigners at the cost of local investors,” one of the legal experts explained.
this was one of the top issues in discussions held at the central bank last week between leaders of the central bank and financial firms.
bankers said that the suppliers’ credit scheme not only affects local investors but the financial institutions themselves because there is a risk their clients may default.
“when the banks secure hard currency they focus on settling the credit rather than approving the lc for other clients who are not included in the supplier’s credit scheme, which is also another effect on local investors,” bankers told capital, “this system has also forced the local producers to be excluded from the market and suffer from bankruptcy due to several expenses including overhead cost and salary for employees that are difficult to avoid”.
“the suppliers credit issue was mentioned in the meeting and we have also asked about the legality of the directive when comparing it with the investment proclamation,” one of the participants at the meeting told capital.
however sources who attended the meeting told capital that any response regarding the supplier’s credit was not given by the governor.
meanwhile sources said that the central bank is looking at the directive to see what to revise. sources said that the governor ordered experts to revise it, however capital was unable to confirm it from yinager dessie (phd).
investors that capital talked to said that they are not against facilitating credit for fdi’s since it is one of the ways to attract new investors. “we are claiming that the law should consider the reality,” an investor who asked to be anonymous said.
they said that if they partly or fully sold their factories to foreigners the factory may be allowed to import input via the supplier’s credit scheme. “we are asking this, why did the government force local investors out from the manufacturing sector using these kinds of tactics. however, at the same time the government pushed the local business community to get involved in the manufacturing business as opposed to focusing on importing finished goods and wholesale trading,” they claimed.
according to manufacturers, currently several businesses like heavy industries in the chemical, metal and some food and beverage and garment companies owned by local investors are up for sale because they are unable to run their usual operation and at the same time the bank loans have to be paid.
when local investors, who have thousands of employees, layoff their workers, it will also affect the social structure, according to experts."
"prominent local and international construction companies are being investigated under suspicion of tax evasion and tax fraud by the ministry of revenue (mor).
among the 33 large tax payer firms, multiple local and international construction companies were forced to pay more than two billion birr. many of these firms have settled or are expected to pay their huge accrued tax bills to the ministry.
last week capital reported that the federal police were undertaking an operation investigating the companies based on the ministry’s audit report. federal police started investigating audit reports made last fiscal year but also reports from previous years as well.
the china acmc engineering corporation p.l.c. was asked to pay 736.2 million birr which it later appealed and paid. teklebrehan ambaye was asked to pay the gap of 222.3 million birr discovered by the investigation audit while, china railway group lrt project was asked to pay 255.4 million birr.
although some of these companies have already paid their back taxes, police continued investigating the audit in suspicion of existence of criminal activity.
the ministry had previously sent the files to the bureau of investigation and the concerned department after examination had closed the case and reported its findings through a letter to the ministry stating that there were no crimes found.
employees of the ministry however opposed the decision of the investigation bureau stating that the decision has to be made after a proper investigation has been conducted.
following the reform of the executive police by the government of prime minister abiy ahmed (phd) some closed files were re-opened.
“we were discouraged by the actions of the police and we were even feeling that the audits we make are useless,” an employee at the ministry told capital.
orbit construction’s two year audit had presented a 26 million birr gap from what they allegedly declared, but following their appeal to the ministry, the amount was lowered to seven million birr according to bekalu menda, general manager of the company.
“the investigation must be for a one million birr transaction made with a man who delivers sand for our site,” said bekalu. “we understand he has printed receipts without the approval of the ministry; and he is still working! if the ministry wants to find him they can. but we paid that difference also to claim it back from him.”
the same thing happened with general mercantile plc which was expected to pay 17.75 million birr.
“we paid the claims through bank loan which has a 10% lower interest than the ministry,” said girma kebede, owner of the company. “we purchased some spare parts, iron and cement but the receipts were not accepted by the ministry. we made a claim to the ministry but they say that it’s not their duty to check the legality of receipts issued with their machine.”
the ministry announced this month that it does not know the whereabouts of over 400 cash register machines that are functioning in the country but are not connected with their server. these machines, they claim are printing receipts without transactions. the former deputy director netsanet abera confirmed to capital that the receipts are not only being used for evading taxes but in addition the taxpayers have asked for tax refunds from the ministry using these fake receipts.
“the problem has hit the innocent tax payers as well but many used it to reduce their cost,” said netsanet at the press conference. “the ministry is also having dialogues to change or update the existing system and to paralyze the machines.”
“whenever we found illegal receipts or similar transactions we sent the findings to the police to investigate if there were criminal elements including the intention of the companies,” said sources at mor. “the legal enforcement, prosecution and the judiciary have to collaborate to bring all transactions to the legal scheme.”
melcon construction plc faced a 78.4 million birr penalty and bokera construction was asked to pay 61.5 million birr. orchid business group plc was also asked to pay 55.5 million birr while gemshu beyene construction plc was asked to pay 74.2 million birr of an audit gap.
crec was required to pay 64.41 million birr, and get-as international received the 26.31 million birr audit gap.
zong mil engineering group, satcon construction plc, hunan hunda road, fincha fuafuate, hawk international finance & construction co. ltd, are also on the list of those being investigated and expected to settle the amounts of 37.3 million, 35.6 million, 13 million, 4.1 million, 2.4 million birr respectively.
the large tax payers office affirms the actual tax remaining to be paid until the end of last week is 340,689,348.73 birr. the same statement revealed that the authority lifted a penalty of 83,567,867.01 birr and the amount paid by some has reached 349,156,679.67. “about 340, 689,348.73 birr is pending as the companies have appealed to the head office,” declared the statement.
the government has claimed that forged receipts and illegal vat reimbursement have become a threat to tax collection. it has also cautioned the business community that it will not tolerate illegal acts and will take measures on those involved."
"after a meeting between bank presidents and the national bank of ethiopia (nbe), which regulates the financial sector, banks are hopeful that nbe bills will be lifted and they will be permitted to create an alternative proposal to the letter of credit (lc) allocation.
the new leaders of nbe and bank heads met on thursday november 1, at the central bank to discuss issues in the financial sector.
on that occasion, hope was secured that the controversial nbe bill directive imposed since 2011 would be lifted, according to sources who attended the meeting.
the directive mandated that all banks except the commercial bank of ethiopia and development bank of ethiopia, both which are state owned, buy 27 percent of nbe bills for every loan disbursement at a three percent interest rate with a five year maturity period.
banks have claimed that the nbe bills shrink their liquidity and smash their capacity to provide loans for clients. they have also argued that the 3 percent interest rate goes against the minimum market rate that nbe itself imposed. when the directive, ‘mfa/ nbebills/001/2011’, became effective the minimum interest rate was 5 percent and then increased to 7 percent a year ago when the birr devalued by 15 percent along with other major hard currencies.
during several discussions including public private dialogue forums the issue was one of the top topics brought up by the private sector but the government strongly defended and rejected the claim. international partners like the international monetary fund (imf) also expressed their concern about the directive. they stated that the directive could affect the private sector’s access to finance.
in 2015 during talks with financial institution leaders including banks, insurance companies and micro finance organizations, the former central bank leaders said that insurance firms may share the burden and be included in similar schemes. however this has not yet been applied in the insurance industry.
on thursday bankers expressed their concern about the directive.
yinager dessie (phd), governor, who chaired the meeting, disclosed that the central bank has created an exit strategy to lift the directive, according to sources.
he said that nbe is working to develop an exit plan. “it is good news for the banking sector,” one of the bank presidents, who requested anonymity, told capital. “in general i think the discussion was fruitful. they are trying to solve challenges faced by the sector but it may be a bit difficult for them to do this in a short period since there are a lot of challenges and they have been imposed for several years,” he added.
the central bank has also given an opportunity for banks to come up with an alternative proposal to implement a lc operation. in relation to the hard currency shortage and fraud the central banks have applied several rules and procedures on the ibd at the banks.
in february 2016 nbe applied a directive known as ‘transparency in foreign currency allocation and foreign exchange management,” directives no.fxd/45/2016’ that made banks provide service to their customers on a first come first serve scheme to tackle misdemeanors at ibd.
however, banks and foreign currency buyers have expressed their complaints about the law, which was amended last year.
in the past banks wanted the regulatory body to ease the new directive that controlled the way banks handle hard currency. they asked the central bank to give them the responsibility of managing the lc process.
they say the directive is not relevant to their day to day activity.
the directive has also imposed priority sectors in terms of access the hard currency at banks.
besides the priority sectors sub article 6.2 of the directive indicated that a bank shall sell foreign currency to its customers on a first come first serve basis.
during thursday’s meeting bankers expressed their concern about the directive which they claim does not benefit banks or customers.
they said illegal actors are still accessing the hard currency and distributing it unfairly. the central bank leaders argued that they applied to directive to create fairness. “they told us to come up with a proposal to replace the directive,” sources said.
the ethiopian bankers association is expected to handle the proposal work.
in a related development, nbe has amended the ‘bank corporate governance directive no. sbb/62/2015’.
this is the first directive that yinager has signed as governor. it replaces the 2015 directive sub article 6.7 into the following: ‘resolution of shareholders meeting shall not come into force before completing registration of the minutes of the meeting at a relevant government agency. however, a dividend payment shall be affected on the date and methods of payment as decided by the ordinary general meeting.’
the replaced sub article was not allowed to settle dividend payments before the completing registration of the minutes of the meeting with appropriate government organ, which is the documents authentication and registration agency."
"commercial farm investors in abobo werada, gambella are complaining about corruption and maladministration in the area which is hindering their businesses and preventing them from expanding.
agro businesses in corn, sorghum, mug bean, and sesame, said the unsafe environment has delayed thirty businesses from opening.
one investor who asked to be anonymous said that his corn is frequently vandalized and stolen by migrants coming from south sudan. “the government really wants to have more commercial farming but in order to do that the environment needs to be safe to attract more commercial investors. abebeo has fertile land suitable for many crops but there is a problem with security. many migrants have come with their animals, damaged my farms and stolen my corn. another problem that occurs is that i am asked to give money to government workers when i pay taxes, renew my license and sell my products. all these hinder my business.”
guay sissay who received 500 hectares in the area said that when he cleared trees to till land, he tried to make charcoal out of the wood he cut. however, the bureau confiscated his license.
“when they gave me the farm for commercial agriculture work, it was full of tree and other plants so i had to cut the trees and clear the place to plant the sesame and mug bean and they told me that i could use the cut trees for charcoal so i got the proper letter to do that. then i began to make charcoal with the trees and pay royalty payments to the region. however, a few months ago they came to my farm and confiscated over 5,000 quintals of charcoal worth over 1.3 million birr.”
“i asked them why they took the charcoal out of my yard and they told me that i was indulging in illegal charcoal making and i said that they were the ones who gave me the permission to do that but they didn’t want to listen me and instead seized the coal and one of my cars and i saw that the tires of the car was moved into the abobo wereda and then they were chasing me in order to arrest me although i did nothing wrong.”
okre omud, head of abebeo werda said “yes we gave investors a license to make charcoal but it was illegally given by some people so we stopped this and confiscated the charcoal. in terms of cases of corruption and maladministration we have done many things to improve this situation now over 90 investors including the billionaire mohamed al-amoudi are working here safely.”
in related news, journalists who went to gambella to report about the issue including capital’s reporter were detained for three hours by the region’s police and were ordered to delete any recordings."
"the federal police are looking into the audit reports of 33 companies, some of which had gone for years without being investigated. twenty of these companies are large tax payers, most of which are giant construction companies. the investigations, which are said to be looking into half a billion birr worth of possible tax evasion, have been separated into three categories.
the police and office of the attorney general (oag) began their investigation this past week. a source confirmed that most of the cases are going to be finished within a month.
the first category is looking closely at hundreds of lost cash register machines. this is becoming a major problem for revenue collection. the investigating team is working to make the people issuing receipts without transactions accountable, which sources in the enquiry said were the most controversial.
“police have not been able to arrest these individuals who took machines because they gave false addresses and disappeared or the machines have been lost,” the source told capital.
another group of people are said to have been declaring incorrect amount of tax. it is possible criminal charges will not be filed against these people, sources disclosed.
the third category involves audit reports revealing intention to evade taxes. this category is most likely to be prosecuted.
the receipts have been printed by the lost cash register machines for consecutive years. the authority has been unable to trace the machines and some of the individuals who issued them. companies have been discovered to be holding these deceptive receipts which the authority says do not involve actual transactions.
capital was not able to obtain comments from the ministry of revenue or police because the investigation is ongoing."
"the 6th world polio day was celebrated in mekelle last week, oct. 24, reaffirming a commitment to stopping the last remaining one percent of the disease for good. during the opening of the program, teguest yilma, national polio plus committee deputy chair stressed that polio should be the second disease eradicated in history.
“it is an extraordinary success for ethiopia to achieve polio free status and it allows us to look ahead with great joy towards polio endgame projects,” teguest said in her address. “still, we realize that now is not the time to rest, as the danger is lurking around. the status of ethiopia as non-infected with polio is threatened with the existence of the virus in neighboring countries like somalia.”
rotary international has been engaged in the eradication of polio worldwide for the past three decades, and in ethiopia since 22 years.
the celebration was held, in the presence of health minister amir aman and state ministers dr. kebede worku, seharela abdulahi and berhanu feyisa during the health sector annual review meeting, where all stakeholders of the fight against polio were in attendance.
in addition to ministry of health representatives across the country, ngos, hospitals, rotarians and rotaractors, partners and allies attended the event.
delegates from core group, bill and melinda gate foundation, cdc, usaid, unicef and who addressed the attendees of the conference. they reiterated the need to raise awareness against polio and to unite communities to fight it emphasizing the necessity to increase joint efforts from all health partners to stem the spread of polio virus.
a joint statement between unicef, rotary and who noted two simultaneous potential outbreaks in the horn of africa due to vaccine-derived poliovirus. outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus can be stopped in the same way as wild polio by vaccinating every child, according to the statement.
“the governments of somalia, kenya and ethiopia, as well as countries across the horn of africa, are committed to working together to stop the outbreaks as soon as possible.”
the number of polio cases has decreased globally from 350,000 every single year in 1988 to just 22 in 2017."
"the ethiopian national cultural center has appealed to the prime minister’s office after over 200 federal police officers came to the center and began making a temporary shelter there. previously the police lived at a camp next to the center.
plans are underway by the cultural center for constructing a building on the 34,500sqm space to display cultural artifacts of ethiopian nations nationalities and peoples.
seble abebe, public relations officer at the center told capital that the police began living in the room without any approval from the appropriate government office. “a week ago the federal police came in to the center and placed six million birr worth of property in the new building’s construction site and began living there. we have told them that this is inappropriate and that the center is to promote our national culture.”
“however they have not left and have begun creating more shelters in the area, we are appealing to the pm office, the police commission and the addis ababa city administration. we are willing to go to court if necessary.” she added that the new building will cost usd 260,000 and will allow for more space which they desperately need.
the federal police commission said they will soon search for another camp and that police only stayed there because there was a shortage of places to camp.
gezahegn abate, public relations head of the ministry of culture and tourism said making a shelter at the cultural center is completely unacceptable.
“we can’t express in words the value of police in protecting our country but we should oppose them when they are doing the wrong thing. the aim of the cultural center is to advocate our cultural dances, clothes and artifacts for the public and sheltering there is not what we expected from the police.”"
"the ministry of revenue froze the assets of turkish multinational, yapi merkezi, when it failed to pay 2.1 billion birr in unpaid taxes. the company undertook the 389km long awash-kombolcha-hara gebaya railway project at a cost of usd 1.7 billion. the ministry also ordered the ethiopian railway corporation (erc) to deposit any money to the revenue office that the company claims.
“the project is more than 80 percent completed and the payment is prorated,” dereje tefera head of information and public relation of erc told capital. “but we received a letter from the ministry.”
“during his latest visit to istanbul president mulatu teshome discussed the specific issue with his counterpart recep tayyip erdoğan,” the company’s attorney abebe balcha told capital. “we are expecting a state level decision to be in favor of us,” he said. “we paid our taxes and the issue is the bilateral relationship between the governments.”
murat ocal, the country manger of the company in ethiopia, stated that the current issue is misinterpretation of the turkish export import (exim) bank loan agreement between turkey and ethiopia. he further expressed confidence that this would soon be corrected.
the turkish government via its exim bank provided a loan worth usd 300 million for this project, which is the biggest ever loan that the turkish government provided for foreign government, while the balance usd 1.4 billion dollar is covered by european financers such as switzerland’s credit suisse.
“we are looking forward to the proper consideration and awaiting an executive decision,” murat told capital.
the company was asked to pay 2.4 billion birr but after it took the case to the tax appellate bench in the ministry it was reduced to 2.1 billion birr. the ministry of finance and economic cooperation in its comment said the audit is correct and must be implemented.
the actions were taken after long negotiations over the last year which involved the ministry of foreign affairs, the turkish embassy, and delegates from turkey.
yapi merkezi is among the ten railway and transit contractors in the world.
a month ago the assets of china communications construction company (cccc) ltd were frozen because an audit determined they owed back taxes.
the company later paid 760 million birr out of the 3.9 billion birr owed and appealed 1.8 billion birr to the ministry’s tax appeal committee.
the ministry found 412 million birr in the chinese construction giant’s frozen account.
the ministry gave one month for cccc to settle the payment prior to freezing the assets. also when prime minister abiy ahmed (phd) went to china he raised the issue to the chinese government officials, according to sources close to the case who also revealed that his efforts did not achieve the desired result so far.
the state owned multinational said they would make a payment prior to the seizure but failed to pay on time. the cccc was asked to settle evaded profit tax, reverse taxation, withholding and vat for the last two years."
"prime minster abiy ahmed (phd) said a salary increase for civil servants would not be imminent because of budget concerns. he said that internal displacement of millions of drought victims has left the government short of funds.
“there are a hundred thousand people who have been displaced from some parts of the country and as a government we have the duty to provide them with food, cover their health costs and there are also many drought victims receiving aid from us so we are spending money on that and we are unable to prioritize other economic issues.”
“the inflation rate has gone down to 12 percent and we hope after agricultural products are harvested inflation will be reduced to single digits.  if we raise salaries at this point we will aggravate inflation and place unnecessary pressure on the market and on the people themselves.”
though the pm did disclose how much money the country had in reserve he did say that the amount grew by 334 percent compared with last year.
he added that the government has worked hard to elongate the debt to china.
“our deal with the chinese government was to pay our debts through commercial loans but  the djibouti – sebeta rail road is not yet operating to bring income for us so we told china that we can’t pay usd 100 million every year and we have been convincing them to pay it via concessional loan agreement which will bring us some relief.’’
he urged his people to help his county when she is in trouble.
“when greece was in a financial crisis the people sold their property to save their county, when ethiopia  is in trouble it is our duty to work extra hard and be more committed to get the most out of people. we have to show our love for our country not by words only but also by action.’’
the parliament members asked the pm why he did not act swiftly  when a group of soldiers unexpectedly came to his office to talk him in an inappropriate manner.
“the way the solders acted was totally wrong but as a leader i have the responsibility to cool down bad things and not to make trouble for the majority of ethiopians. inside my heart i was very angry but i talked to the solders with a smile.”
he asked the media and political groups to be more ethical and professional.
“i am not saying all media are acting wrongly but some media are working in the wrong way and need quick attention to adjust their problem .’’
during the recent cabinet reshuffle the number for ministers was cut from 28 to 20 the gender composition became half women and half men. he also gave key positions such as minister of peace and defense to women ministers.
the women include:  muferiat kamil – minister of peace, aisha mohammed – minister of defense and the former  deputy mayor of  addis ababa ,dagmawit moges   as minister of transport."
"the ministry of revenue announced that during the first quarter of the fiscal year they collected 3.21 billion birr less revenue than they expected. income collected from inland tax during the first quarter was expected to be 28.8 billion birr.
the gap is even higher because there is seven billion birr in uncollected customs duties which has raised the amount of uncollected revenue to 10.72 billion birr, according to netsanet abera, deputy director at the ministry.
“the decline in revenue is lower than the same period during the last fiscal year,” netsanet told journalists. “we are hoping the gap will be filled by revenue that we collect this month when 90 percent of taxpayers pay their annual taxes.”  at the beginning of the current fiscal year, the parliament approved a 346.9 billion birr budget and 70 percent of that was to be generated from taxes and customs duties. the budget which was 3.6 percent (12 billion birr) higher than the previous fiscal year was five percent lower than the 2017/18 budget year due to the 15% devaluation of birr against the basket of major currencies.
prime minister abey ahmed (ph.d.) told the parliament while defending the budget that the plan to finish mega projects and start  new projects this fiscal year may not happen because they have generated enough  revenue.  abraham tekeste (ph.d.), former minister at mofec, also told the parliament that the nation will be forced to transfer disbursement of 50 billion birr for the coming year.
despite the government’s action  to tighten its projects and avoid an elastic budget, the ministry failed to meet its plan compared to last year.
non-declared transactions are the biggest reason for lack of revenue collection, according to netsanet. “the culture of demanding receipts must be raised in addition to better law enforcement from the ministry,” she said."
"ethiopian revenues and customs authority lost more than 400 cash register machines. they have been reported to the authority both by tax payers and importers. the authority claimed they had a database which could control the machines but it was able to deactivate around 20 from the server.
the large tax payer office (lto) found 50 tax payers out of its 1,100 clients, last fiscal, year using illegal receipts. the companies were carrying 1,583 forged receipts which are worth 703 million birr. the branch conducted a risk based investigation audit on 22 companies out of 50 founded a 8.5 billion birr audit gap which it reported to the law enforcement office at the end of the year. lto also discovered 1164 forged receipts from other branches worth 720 million birr.
the machines which are stolen or lost can only be used to print receipts.
last week the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) discovered that out of  67 cash register machines 57 were using a a single shelf in one office.
“we are investigating if these machines are among the lost ones. however, there were no transactions and the machines were active,” brhanu abate.
brhanu went on to say that the machines were discovered in several sub-cities.
a criminal investigation will be conducted. this has especially been a problem on construction sites where the contractor receives a receipt when items are delivered.  even though the prosecution department closed the case in the absence of the intention criminal activity could easily be traced by the auditors before sending their report.
“every purchaser has the responsibility to do the transaction at the registered working place of the supplier, according to the commercial law,” said hirut mebrate, head of the lto. “our job in an audit is to see if there is a violated law.”
research done by the authority reveals that there are three ways of issuing these receipts and mafia groups are involved. this also contributed greatly to the failure of the revenue collection in recent fiscal years.
hidden tax payers recruit unemployed or low income individuals and issue a license in their name. the recruits will receive some tip for this activity and most of the time they don’t understand the sophisticated deal behind what is going on. the tax payers will take a cash register machine in their name and will disappear. the well known court case of biniyam g/mariyam et al was the milestone in such a case.
also sometimes tax payers will issue the license and will report their revenue initially but will disappear instantly as they start to issue receipts for non-issued transactions.
another illegal method is using stolen or lost machines but with the memory of another person who is operating legally somewhere in the country. they will use the phone number, tin number name and other details of the legal tax payer and print the receipt for the other person. the legal tax payer will be told that they need to pay taxes for a transaction they made, but they will disprove this by showing the real transaction at the same date or time.
the most complicated scam, which can be operated by computer professionals, is that they will design the receipt to be similar with the legal one and they will use similar software with the existing one.
“our current system can’t trace the lost machines,” tewodros w/mariyam, technology leader at the authority told capital. “but we propose a new system which can automatically paralyze them. i hope that system will be applicable soon.”"
"at the opening of parliament the president promised several economic changes would be taken by the government in the budget year.
president mulatu teshome (phd), who recalled the challenges that the country faced in the political, social and economic sphere in the past few years, stated that several improvements will take place in the remaining period of the gtp ii and this budget year.
the president said that the situation in the past frustrated the private sector. “the revitalization policy is expected to be in place to back the economic development and we should grow as we did in the past,” mulatu said in his opening speech on monday october 8.
in his speech that expressed the government’s plan for the year he indicated that under the development of a democratic developmental free market the government will work to stabilize the macroeconomic condition and improve of socio economic development.
“we will work to improve the implementation of the free market and expand the country’s process in international economic integration based on fair competition and clarity,” he said.
the monetary and fiscal policy will be strongly followed to normalize the macroeconomic condition, according to the plan for the year.
government revenue and expenditures are the other priority areas for the year.  in the past two years the government worked to minimize expenditures in federal offices and implement tight budget controlling mechanisms. however, tax collection also significantly declined in the past budget year. according to the communiqué of the congress of the ruling party that concluded a week ago tax collection will be one of their top priorities for the year.
last year the government was able to collect 200 billion birr from the target of 250 billion. the country’s tax  to gdp ratio is one of the poorest in the region, according to international financial organizations. based on last year’s report the country’s tax to gdp ratio is less than 13 percent, which is lower than the regional average. the government is looking to improve it to 17 percent in 2020.
debt management is the other priority area for the year. the country has been stressed from debt because of some projects that are lagging or are running below expectation. this has forced the government to suspend most foreign commercial loans for the past two years. mismanagement of finance was also stated as one of the major challenges which has caused the country to be unable to perform well in terms of foreign loans.
according to the government’s plan, the loan management will be undertaken as per the expected limit, although the limit was not directly stated. the government guarantee would be also minimized in the coming periods, according to the president’s speech.
in addition, non public sectors or the private sector will also be included in the public financial scheme, which would be a new thing for the country.
the capital market is also stated as one of the new operations for the year, while details were not given. the president’s speech directly mentioned the insurance sector saying that they will improve their operation and insurance coverage. the non performing loans (npl) of the banks was also covered by the president’s speech as he said it would be improved under international standards.
except for the development bank of ethiopia the ethiopian banking sector was run on its good npl standard at a level of 5 percent but experts stated the past year’s performance was not like the previous trend.
capital reported that over the past few months that the highest npl ever occurred during the previous fiscal year since the economic condition was very poor during that budget year.
experts argued that the last year’s hard currency shortage and instability has forced the business community mainly manufacturers to run under their regular performance causing them to have difficulty settling their debts on time. “the effect on the private sector is directly seen in the financial industries since they are working together,” experts told capital in the past few months.
in his speech which mostly covered economic issues the president hinted that several economic policies and laws would be ratified or amended in the budget year.
in addition  several restructures at the federal level are expected to take place in the coming few weeks when the pm comes to the parliament.
about two months ago capital reported that the number of ministries and cabinet members would be slashed. in its latest meeting the council of ministers announced that the number of cabinet members would be reduced to 20 from 28."
"a chinese detergent factory in alme gena has been shut down after the ministry of trade found that the company produced low quality products and distributed it to the market without obtaining the proper license.
the company which produced soap and powder detergent under the brand name lavi and panda was closed last week. depending on laboratory studies further legal action may be taken.
earlier this month the ministry of trade began an investigation after receiving complaints that people using the detergent were having health problems and that it could cause environmental damage.  inspection officers for the ministry told capital that the company sold the product without getting approval from the appropriate government body.
“results showed that the samples were sub-standard and taken from mercato. when we first went to the company some employees tried to prevent us from entering but we finally moved inside the company and found that there were unlawful activities occurring.”
the inspectors would not reveal the name of the company.
in related news the inspectors added that road sheet products coming from the eastern part of the country are being distributed improperly.
the sheets are lower quality and below standard. they are being sold to rural farmers at a very low price and coming from unknown suppliers.
“the products are very thin and are not coated with proper painting we have found several sheets in the market and we will work to stop this.’’
“the bad part of using the product is they are easily pierced by small objects and which leads to additional cost for the customers. the reflection that comes off the sheet could cause additional problems as well.”"
"belaya industrial plc which sold bottled water under the brand name “classy,” has been closed, against their will, for the last two weeks. now they plan to sue the ministry of trade.
the company, located near suluta in oromia zone, was closed by the ministry over concerns with the quality of their water. the company has responded by saying the lab results are unreasonable.
the ethiopia conformity assessment (eca) gave a letter to the company saying there was no problem with the quality of their water.
however, the ministry says a lab test that they took four months ago failed to meet the required total plate count. a plate count test basically looks at all the organisms in the water and determines if it is safe to consume.
dagne yesegat, owner of the company said the decision is unfair and cost 270 workers their jobs.
“we were going to export our water but now we have been shut down, i don’t understand how two government agencies can come up with two separate quality assessments.”
dagne went on to say that it was unfair for the announcement of the problem to go to the media before it went to them and they plan to sue unless they are allowed to re-open.
kasshaun mulat, trade inspection director for the ministry of trade told capital that the company was closed after several warnings.
“we have been sending them letters for two years and they have not adjusted the quality. they may have gotten assurance from eca but that doesn’t have anything to do with the quality results in our laboratory.”
belaya industrial plc was producing 24,000 bottles of water per day in various sizes. the company was established four years ago with an investment of 13 million birr. its factory is on 20,000sqm. they sourced their water from entoto mountain."
"the ruling coalition, ethiopian people’s revolutionary democratic front (eprdf), has concluded the highly anticipated 11th congress at hawassa town, the capital of snnp region.
during the three day event from october 3, the coalition representatives comprised of 250 voting members from four parties talked about several issues in addition to a report going over achievements of the 10th congress and proposed agendas to be undertaken in the next two years.
during the closed sessions the participants raised several issues including the current reforms in the political, social and economic sphere.
sources who attended the closed session told capital that participants expressed their concern about the border issues between sudan and ethiopia and internal border issues. the coming of opposition leaders from abroad and handling the growing ethnic based political instability was raised during the congress. the economic policy and strategy and achievement on regional policy including the progressing peace condition between ethiopia and eritrea, sudan and south sudan and djibouti and eritrea was appreciated by the participants, according to fekadu tesema, the congress spokesperson.
he said during the first day of the closed session the congress gave priority to the current affairs and the report of the 11th congress.the participants encouraged the move of the new leadership that amplified hope in the country. opening of the political space and allowing opposition leaders to enter to the country besides influential figures were also stated to be positive achievements over the past few months.
the national reconciliation which improved the multi-party system is also stated as a success registered in the past few months. the collation communiqué also amplified that the multi-party system will be the next move of the country.
the coalition has also agreed to work together to support the current change.
political party reform was also intensely discussed. capital was unable to confirm for sure but sources said the party’s political ideology was expected to be debated.
the party document distributed at the congress stated that the ideological development would be undertaken.
tax
the congress discussed improving vat collection. documents show that vat revenue has declined. one reason for this is that people are hiding their vat tax returns. meanwhile, other tax payers declare bankruptcy to avoid paying taxes.
these are problems that the government plans to work on changing. the imf recently released a report saying that government revenue has not improved compared with gdp.
the government planned for tax collection to be 17 percent of gdp by the end of the current five year plan. however tax collection compared with gdp has hovered at around 12 percent.
vat collection and the general tax collection by the ethiopian revenue and customs authority (erca) only achieved three fourths of targets this past fiscal year. this is the highest gap between expectations and reality in history.
for the 2017/18 budget year erca planned to collect about 200 billion birr, but in reality they collected 150 billion.
the party promised to take legal action against people who break the tax law, trade in contraband and beak investment laws.
they announced plans to reform the tax system, something which has been talked about in the past but not applied.
agriculture
the party continues to want farmers to transition from subsistence farming to growing crops to be sold at the market. as it has been since the first gtp in 2010 developing irrigation will be one of their top strategies. other programs like mechanized farming, bio technology, strategic crops and specialization in farm areas will be implemented in the next two years.
the diversification of the agricultural input suppliers and quality supply in addition to an organized financial scheme are new strategies for the coming two years. horticulture development, improving technology and aquaculture development are other new programs. the report stated that technological transformation and research and extension works will be applied in aquaculture and livestock production. hopes are that more hard currency will be earned from livestock sales.
manufacturing
industrial parks will be pushed to begin producing as soon as possible. special support for those who are expanding production and export will be given. even though the government has attempted to transition to a manufacturing economy since the first gtp the actual performance has been very poor.
to tackle the problem, the government has engaged in developing the parks. the hawassa industry park has been a pioneer in this regard. however several well-known international have come to open shop at the park, although it has not been as much as hoped.
hard currency revenue from hawassa industry park has not exceeded usd 25 million, while projections indicated that it would take in usd one  billion per year.
one of the major reasons for this has been that starting production has been delayed at the factories; as a result the government plans to support investors that begin production right away.
plans are for the import substation to be a priority as has been the case previously. the report stated that there are around 5,000 products that are being imported which can easily be produced here, such as powdered milk.  every year the country allocates a significant amount of hard currency to importing basic food items like wheat, oil and sugar, while 4/5 of the total population works in agricultural production.
forex
the document noted several plans for getting more foreign exchange into the country in addition to increasing earnings from exports. it called for new studies to be undertaken to expand the amount of hard currency individuals bring into the country.
remittances actually bring in more foreign currency into ethiopia than export earnings. although, that figure declined when there was a boycott by the diaspora and a problem with illegal remittances. however, since pm abiy came to power and reformed the political arena remittances have increased.
another plan to bring more foreign currency into the country is to privatize some public enterprises which would secure cash that would then be invested. in addition the report lists strategies like stopping contraband trade, under invoicing and illicit trade methods, as well as suspending and postponing some government projects until hard currency earnings improve.
social development
the document announced several plans to improve living conditions. the party is looking to the mining sector to improve wealth and contribute to local economies. since many people are migrating from rural to urban areas, job opportunities and an urban development program must be created.
the condo housing project has made housing more accessible over the last decade. recently the government in addis ababa introduced a saving scheme through the 20/80 and 40/60 programs for condominium homes. however there is still a huge housing shortage, prices are skyrocketing and many are not able to afford their monthly saving plan.
now, the government is coming up with a new housing strategy.
they will facilitate a plot of land and a loan program for private home developers. the document stated that unlike the previous policy land and finance will be facilitated for house developers. “the government will minimize its role and directly engage with home developers to develop houses,” it added. in addition foreign real estate developers will be able to engage in the housing scheme in addition to local investors.
at the end of the congress eligible voters which are usually known as central committee members elected their chair and deputy.
the central committee (cc) is made up of 45 people from 4 parties. according to the information capital obtained, 178 cc members out of 180 participated on the last day of election.
except for muferiat kamil, chair of southern ethiopian people’s democratic movement (sepdm), demeke mekonen, chair of the amhara democratic party (adp),  abiy ahmed (phd) chair of oromo democratic party (odp), and debretsion gebremichael (phd), chair of the tigrayan people’s liberation front (tplf) competed for the chairman and deputy positions.
according to the election result 177 members have voted and abiy, who come to power in march was re- elected with 176 votes to chair the party for the coming two years. one vote went to demeke. for the deputy chairmanship demeke who is currently deputy chair beat out debretsion. he secured 149 votes for the deputy chair position; while debretsion got 15 votes, 13 did not vote."
"even though the ratio of non-performing loans (npls) at the development bank of ethiopia (dbe) has been sharply soaring, the bank’s management is optimistic this will change now that several problems have been addressed.
the policy bank that mainly supports developmental projects in the country has been going through rough times when clients defaulted on loans they received for development projects mainly involving rain fed commercial farming.
at a press conference held on september 28 to review the past fiscal year’s performance the management of the bank disclosed that the bank’s npl ratio grew to almost 40 percent for the year.
they explained that in the 2016/17 fiscal year ratio of npls stood at 25 percent, which at the time was the worst performance the bank had experienced. this fiscal year, however, npls escalated even more to 39.4 percent, according to a report presented by dbe management.
“the national bank of ethiopia’s standard is that npls not to be higher than 15 percent, which is in line with other international trends,” haileyesus bekele, the recently assigned president of dbe said.
he believes that if the hard currency shortages are solved then npls will decrease significantly.
over the past year npls have grown rapidly primarily because of problems with rain fed agriculture investments and the shortage of hard currency. power outages and damage to investments during periods of political instability were secondary reasons for the increase as well.
haileyesus told capital that dbe will take action including legal measures to get its assets however he declined to spell out in detail what this would entail.
the bank has been affected by the failure of rain fed commercial farming mainly in gambela region.
haileyesus said that when it came to rain fed agriculture investment, 471 projects throughout ethiopia secured loans from the bank and out of this number 25 percent invested in their business but failed to profit.
there are 298 projects or 60 percent that dbe claims they partially invested in which also contributed to the growth of the npls, according to the president.
“the remaining 56 projects were not totally invested in and the bank is taking actions to solve the problem,” he added.
he was critical of how the bank handled rain fed agricultural investments. “they were applied without undertaking a detailed and scientific feasibility study,” he added.
“some of the rain fed investments failed because there was no study on the plantation like sesame at gambela, which failed because it had too much rain and the land was not  suitable again because it was not properly studied,” he told capital. he said that lack of coordination with relevant bodies has been another problem with the rain fed projects.
the bank has also hinted that it may find ways to improve its capacity by reforming the existing loan policy, hiring an international consultant and increasing the bank’s capital.
“currently, our paid up capital stands at 7.9 billion birr but the bank’s capital adequacy ratio has reached its maximum rate of 15 percent as per the central bank rule,” he said.
“because of this and handling the level of the investment growth volume the bank capital will definitely grow this year fiscal year,” he explained.
for the past fiscal year the bank has dispersed 39 billion birr from the total of 59 billion approved. dbe has total assets of 78.2 billion birr and has registered a net profit of 367 million birr after taxes and provisions. a year ago the profit stood at 324 million, but in its heyday in the 2014/15 fiscal year the profit reached 678 million birr."
"the pharmaceutical fund and supply agency (pfsa) temporarily stopped supplying medicine to private pharmacies as of september 20, 2018. the agency previously supplied medicine both to private and public health centers including private pharmacies.
pfsa conducted an investigation on how the medicine it distributes was being used and discovered that the way private pharmacies were conducting business went against what the agency intended, according to public relations director, adna bere.
“there is no clear policy stating the agency must supply medicine to private medical centers or pharmacies,” she said.
“we supplied medicine to private health centers because our charter allows us to circulate our resources after our costs are covered. however, we are seeing that the pharmacies are not working to help people access medication at a fair price, but instead are charging high prices.”
the research also revealed that most of the medicines purchased were sold to these pharmacies, instead of supplying them to public health centers and pharmacies.
pharmacy owners capital talked with expressed their concern that the decision will create shortages and inflation of items they usually buy from pfsa.
“i thought this was just the usual 20 day or so summertime pause,” said the owner of a private pharmacy.
the agency has 19 branches all over the country after adding a second branch in addis last year. it supplies medicine for 300 hospitals and 3,600 health governmental health centers.
“the ban is temporally and it will be removed,” said adna.
the agency did not say when the ban would be lifted."
"the addis ababa education bureau which supervises private schools to capital it has closed 59 schools due to violations like unqualified teachers, not having a library, laboratory, sport fields, or unsanitary toilets and dilapidated sleeping areas for children.
thirty four of the closed schools are kindergartens, 14 primary schools and nine are high schools. four high schools received a final warning and will have to be evaluated at the end of this fiscal year in order to continue operating.
last year the bureau revoked licenses for 35 schools.
the bureau found that the school owners were more interested in making money than maintaining standards in schools.
students from these schools were advised to enroll elsewhere before the start of the school year, which began last week.
primary and high schools are supposed to have a standard classroom and a sports field where kids can play basketball and volleyball. the kg must have a neat and a comfortable teaching classroom and sleeping room for the children.
fikerte abera, deputy director of education relevance and quality at the bureau told capital that the supervision was performed with a strict checklist and the schools are being closed to improve the quality of education.
she added that although private schools are contributing to the educational development of the state, they must operate within the law.
she said that the government took action after several warnings by the inspectorate unit of the bureau for the proprietors meet the set standards
“the decision to embark on the closure of poor schools across our capital city is a deliberate step towards improving the standards of quality education in addis, we will not tolerate schools operating without a laboratory, toilet and library,” she said.
fikerte said the schools also failed to scale through the verification carried out by the task force set up by the bureau. she said that supervision will be a continuous exercise and any school that fails  to meet the requirements at any point will  be shut down, until such school does what is expected.
currently 1,631 private schools are operating in addis ababa among these 919 are kindergartens, 569 primary schools and 143 high schools."
"zewditu memorial hospital is in talks with the indian’s overseas infrastructure alliance (oia) to purchase the india eye care centre which has been closed for the last two years because of violations. the eye care center which consumed usd 2.5 million to build and install machines, opened in march 2014 inside the compound of zewditu hospital. however, it was soon closed when the government discovered the center was charging high fees when it was supposed to provide subsidized services for the poor.  zelalaem chemdisa, ceo of zewditu memorial hospital  told capital that they  plan give oia money so they can own the center.
“it is painful to see the center closed and lack of services. we are willing to help compensate oia for the money they put into the center and we have gotten a positive response. it everything works out we hope to reopen the center.”
the center which has 15 bed dedicated state of the art and ultra-modern ophthalmology facility center was built  to  offer relief to patients suffering from conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes related eye problems and plastic surgery around the eyes. the facility also has an in-house training center for surgeons, paramedics and administrative staff to improve local human resources and was built in technical collaboration with an indian center of excellence which provides medical advisory and consultancy services.
oia had planned to treat 100,000 patients and perform 10,000 sight restoring surgeries at the center in about three years and also planed to introduce mobile eye care clinics in the remote areas.
overseas infrastructure alliance (oia) is a project development and management company with offices in india, ethiopia, mozambique, tanzania, republic of congo, burkina faso, rwanda, sudan and maldives.
over 285 million people around the world suffer from visual impairments, and over 80% of their suffering is easily avoidable.
according to the vision2020 report, it is a little known fact that 90% of visually impaired people live in low- and middle-income countries, over two-thirds are women, and 65% are over 50. this is primarily because they lack access to optical help, with some countries having less than one ophthalmologist per million people. the lack of access to eye care services is leading to blindness, caused by avoidable or curable conditions."
"south korean based company, ekos steel plc which started selling bars and wires to customers    last wednesday may stop production and close the company after one month due to a shortage of hard currency which is needed to import raw material.
ekos, located on ten hectares of land in dukem, asked government banks for usd 70 million to  buy raw material from global steel companies like posco in south korea and arcelor mittal in ukraine and turkey. currently it only has enough material in reserve to produce steel for one month.
ekos, which has worked for three decades in south korea, obtained an investment license in june 2014 and. their plan was to produce 210,000 tons rebar and wire rod products to substitute imports and to enhance this capacity to 500,000 tons per year during the second phase.
the company makes galvanized steel sheets, hot and cold rolling mills, and steel tubes. they also operate a steel coil service center, and provide steel manufacturing management and engineering work.
shell h. choo ceo of ekos told capital that the company may not continue to operate in ethiopia if they don’t get the hard currency.
“the construction completion has been delayed for two years because of the hard currency shortage and we have built the factory yet we face another currency shortage, we are tirelessly working to get the hard currency but if we can’t we will have to stop production and lay off employees.”
“the government should understand our problem because of our project, this country will be able to save usd 50 million annually. this will facilitate the work of the construction sector. we are also considering exporting to neighboring countries which will bring in foreign currency,” he said.
currently the company has 100 workers and nine of them are south koreans.
solomon mulugeta from the ethiopian steel and metals producers association said that most of the steel companies are performing below 15 percent of capacity due to the hard currency shortage.
“with the right amount of hard currency in loans, the sector can produce three million pieces of rebar and wires per year. however, because of the hard currency shortage the sector is performing below 15 percent and the wide gap between supply and demand is affecting the price of bars and wires and preventing buildings from being built on time.”
“even the dollar that is available in the banks are not properly given to the sectors due to nepotism and corruption. as an association we have asked the national bank of ethiopia for assistance but they have not responded.”
currently the steel industry needs usd six billion but they have only gotten around 25 percent of this.
the sector employs 50,000 people and if the hard currency problem continues it may start firing workers.
the country annually imports 70 million tons of steel and the local capacity is around three million tons. currently, there are around 241 small, medium and large factories involved in steel and iron production.
recently, prominent aluminum cookware manufacturer kaluworks ethiopia plc, shut their doors. despite being in business for two decades they were recently doomed by lack of inputs."
"dubai company offers lowest price in wheat re-bid after failing to live up to promisesthey say if you don’t succeed once try and try again.  that apparently is the motto of dubai based promising international trading co, which despite failing to live up to their end of the bargain when they won a bid to deliver wheat this past june, returned and offered the lowest price during the public procurement and property disposal service (pppds) re-bid early last week.
last june the company, which is not new to the ethiopian market, agreed to supply 200,000 metric tons of wheat but because of what they said were technical reasons like a delay in the letter of credit or disagreements with eslse did not deliver. this contributed to a wheat shortage over the past few months forcing the service to float another bid this month.
last tuesday when the bid documents were opened eight companies participated and seven of them met the requirements to supply wheat.
promising international offered usd 272.05 per metric ton for lot 1 (a unit of measurement) and usd 284.8 for lot 2 or usd 55.68 million in total. in this bid pppds specified that the wheat be transported via eslse vessels.
this time their bid increased by usd 20.75 and usd 30 for lot 1 and 2 respectively compared with their previous offer, which in june was usd 258.05 per metric ton for lot 1 and usd 262.05 for lot 2, both lots consist of 100,000 metric tons each, for the shipment via ethiopian shipping and logistics services enterprise (eslse) vessels or usd 251.3 for lot 1 and usd 254.8 for the shipment on other vessels up to the port of djibouti.
us based bunge limited, had the second lowest offer at usd 298.25 and usd 288.25 per ton for the 1st and second lot respectively, which is 58.65 million for the total. hakan agro dmcc, a dubai company which offered the second lowest price in june, offered usd 296.33 and 290.33 per ton for each lot for usd 58.66 million in total making their bid the third lowest.
the fact that the company was allowed to re-bid after failing the first time has confused professionals capital spoke with. the sector actors said that the service reported the previous default to the public procurement and property administration agency (pppaa), but since the agency did not take action in time the company was able to take part in another round of bidding.
jonse gedefa, deputy director general of pppaa, told capital that these types of conditions will occur until the agency gives a final decision. “companies will participate in open bids until the agency gives feedback or blacklists some of them,” he added.
he said that this decision may be delayed since the claim came recently.
yigezu daba, head of pppds, told capital that the board for review and resolution of complaints at the agency is responsible for deciding whether a company should be banned. until the decision is given the company can participate in the bid, he said.
yigezu added that the company claimed they faced problems preventing them from fulfilling their contract because eslse revised their cost for freight after they made the agreement with promising. wheat is one of ethiopia’s most imported agriculture products. the ministry of trade has attempted to stabilize the local market by allocating hundreds of millions of usd."
"lumpy skin disease (lsd), an acute infectious viral skin infection affecting cattle, broke out in the states of oromiya, southern nations, nationalities &peoples (snnp) and amhara. the disease spread rapidly because the national veterinary institute (nvi) couldn’t deliver a vaccine on time.
it permanently damages the skin of the cattle and rapidly decreases production. it also causes high fever and other significant damage to them. globally it has a 10% mortality rate.
the virus, which is very closely related to sheep and goat pox, usually occurs during periods of high insect activity such as in the summer months, and more significantly in the wet areas.
zewdnesh, a dairy producer, lives in bishoftu town. she had nine cows, but lost one from the lsd infection which caused a secondary infection in the respiratory system. the cow could have earned her 50,000 birr and would provide her around 20 liters of milk per month.
“except for one of my cows, which appears to have natural immunity, all of my cows are sick,” she told capital. “the dairy production is very low and the cows are suffering, the problem is spreading around my neighborhood.”
the ethiopian ministry of livestock and fisheries, which is mandated to supply the vaccine to the regions, said it couldn’t deliver the vaccine because the sole vaccine producer and supplier nvi failed to deliver on time.
“we ordered the vaccine a long time ago but they didn’t supply it to us. considering the gravity of the outbreak in the arsi zone we were obliged to take 350,000 doses of vaccines from our snnp stock,” said dr. girma a coordinator for health regulation at the directorate. “we gave the nvi two weeks which is almost expired. if they don’t deliver on time we will take action.”
the nation’s sole veterinary vaccination production institute reported that it lost five million doses of lsd vaccinations this year. nvi says it lost one machine which is meant to hold the vaccine dormant because of a power problem.
“we lost 10 million doses of vaccines in total. we may lose additional vaccines if the generator fails,” kenaw birhanu, production and sales manager said.
the disease is known to minimize the dairy production by up to 50% and has  a possible mortality rate of 10%. also, it makes the skin of the cattle non-usable.
the ministry also stated that the strain was receiving multiple of complaints which the evi was supposed to consider early.
“we are conducting research to change the strain and the issue is also a major problem in fighting the virus on the continent. unfortunately, we were not able to make the new strain ready for this year,” said kenaw. “we are worried if we lose the bread bacteria recovering will be too hard.”
the evi which is based in bishoftu town said it reported the problem multiple items to various bodies but there was no solution.
also as the disease is known for creating a secondary infection in open tissues it is recommended not to eat the meat of the cattle or use any products from them.
but, a couple of farmers which capital talked to in bishoftu town are selling the milk.
according to government statistics, there are approximately 50 million cattle, 50 million goats and sheep, plus an assortment of horses, donkeys, camels, and chickens."
"the addis ababa trade bureau in collaboration with the national intelligence and information service bureau and trade ministry has closed 74 shops in addis ababa in the last month for exchanging hard currency at their businesses. the majority; 64, of the shops are located in kirkos sub city, four are in bole and six are in addis ketema.
during the black market raid usd 80,615, euro 13,750, and 8,877 saudi riel were confiscated from the shops. in addition 3,237 uae dirham, 1,130 yuan, 83,000 libyan dinar, 423 kuwaiti  dinar, 3 oman riel, 173 bahrain dinar and 2,870 south african rand  were also confiscated. there was also 12.4 million    birr confiscated that was going to be used to exchange the hard currency.
although the rate has been in flux one dollar currently goes for around 29 birr on the black market which is a 1.50 birr difference from the banks.
experts who closely follow the sector say the black market reduction over the past week is a result of relative stability in the country and more hard currency entering ethiopia since the new pm took office.
the hard currency shortage, the stagnation of export earnings and illegal market or contraband were some of the reasons for the recent rise in the black market rate which at one point reached around 38 for one usd.
in other news the trade bureau confiscated 8,870 liters of palm oil, one isuzu truck fully loaded with clothes and textiles, 153 packs of clothes, 50 quintals of red pepper, 23 cartoons and 95 quintals of sugar   and medicine that were being traded illegally.
regions like oromia are also working strongly to control the contraband business, stopping goods from entering the country illegally. this has led to some conflict in the somali and oromia regions over the past year."
"financial industry pundits are recommending that the government reevaluate the suppliers’ credit scheme which excludes local investors and instead give priority to foreign companies. they say getting the letter of credit up front breaches the first come first serve directive of national bank of ethiopia.
the banking industry leaders that have links to the local and foreign based businesses, and  fdi, argue that the supplier’s credit scheme not only affects local investors but the financial institutions themselves because there is a default risk from their clients.
one of the prominent private bank presidents, who requested anonymity, told capital that initially the notion of the supplier’s credit indirectly forced the banks that applied without the consultation of them to settle the payment with maturity date. “it has forced the banks to face a default risk which affects the country,” he said.
the supplier’s credit by itself is given priority to the clients who are allowed to access the scheme and not those who registered and are waiting to get the lc.
“when the banks secure hard currency they focus on settling the credit rather than approve the lc for its other clients who are not included on the supplier’s credit scheme, which is also another effect on local investors,” dereje zebene, president of zemen bank said.
concerns are also being raised by experts that the scheme is genuine or free from any misbehavior. “it has to be cross checked whether it is a genuine supplier or not, besides that the cost includes hidden expense like interest,” they stressed.
the sector actors stated that the supplier’s credit might also promote the parallel (black) market. “we are seeing that sometimes their supplier’s credit is processed from djibouti. who is there in djibouti?” bankers that capital spoke questioned. they noted that the imported items have already reached djibouti by those who have a stake in the parallel market.. they said that it may show that illegal actors are using this scheme to abuse the legal market.
“it is obvious that those who have advantage in the supplier’s credit scheme are enjoying the market without competition from other local producers,” asfaw alemu, president of dashen bank told capital. “this system has also forced the local producers to be excluded from the market and suffer from  bankruptcy due to  several expenses including overhead cost and salary for employees that are difficult to avoid,” he added.
“if they have debt in banks they will also be unable to settle their credit, which forced banks to seize the assets. but it needs adequate data to speak on it and indicate the effect on companies and at the same time on banks,” asfaw explained.
“when this kind of crisis occurs it becomes difficult for banks to sell the assets of defaulted investors since there won’t be real buyers because all banks have assets to sell out,” dereje said.
when local investors, who have thousands of employees, layoff their workers, it will also affect the social structure, according to experts. “the supplier’s credit scheme that excludes local investors will also allow foreign companies to be the major market actors, which is against stand the national identity,” one banker said.
“it is not acceptable to exclude local companies to access foreign currency in the scheme,” another banker added.
addisu haba, president of ethiopian bankers association and debub global bank, told capital that the local banks do not have a problem with the local currency to settle the credit. “but the scheme has forced banks to pay the supplier’s credit with foreign currency which is highly scarce when the maturity date comes,” he said.
“if the foreign companies who are engaged in export it would be acceptable but the supplier’s credit scheme includes all actors who sell their products locally or export them,” the association head said.
“since the government endorsed the new directive we did not facilitate lc for clients coming in the usual trend,” a bank president who did not want to be named said.
“since i gave the suppliers credit i have to also settle the payment when the maturity date comes. so it will be difficult for my bank to approve other lcs since the priority is for credit settlement,” he added.
another banker also argued that the credit scheme has escalated the shortage of the hard currency. “a hard currency shortage at banks is observed,” he argued.
he also stated that local investors who already borrowed a huge amount of money from local banks have defaulted since they could not produce and cover their costs and other required settlements including scheduled debt payment.
it has been reported that in the past fiscal year the percentage of banks with non-performing loans (npl) has grown compared with the previous trend, but banks declined to verify this.
addisu said that members of the association did not discuss the issue. “it is difficult for me to comment on it since i do not have organized data,” he added.
a president of one of the oldest private banks told capital that as per the nbe law his bank has given priority to clients that have a support letter from nbe for the scheme of suppliers credit whether it imports priority items or not.
“local companies that have a support on priority criteria of nbe would not get priority because we don’t have adequate resources and give prime service for clients with supplier’s credit,” he said. “if the supplier’s credit had not come into effect we would serve several clients who are waiting in the queue,” he added.
the bankers said that they tabled the challenge for the new governor, yenager dessie (phd), during the one to one discussion with every bank leader, but they said that the new governor needs more time for change.
most of the bankers agreed that the supplier’s credit has affected their businesses. besides that they insist the government should open the hard currency allocation as opposed to strictly controlling it. the government has put the first come first serve into priority sectors but it is not effective."
"africa insurance company registered impressive achievements during the 2017/18 fiscal year, despite economic challenges in the insurance sector.
african insurance is one of the oldest private insurance companies and one of the three most profitable. they amassed 585 million birr from life and general insurance premiums.
africa was formed 24 years ago. it has been able to collect over half a billion birr in premiums. during the 2016/17 fiscal year they earned 553 million birr from general and non-life insurance premiums. a year ago that figure was 494 million birr.  “the growth of general insurance for the year stood at 12 percent,” kiros jiranie, president of africa insurance, said.
the company collected 32 million birr from life insurance, an increase from 27 million during the 2016/17 fiscal year.
in the reported year the company settled 391 million birr in claims, which is a 16 percent increase. a year ago africa insurance settled 314 million birr claims for general insurance.
from the underwriting result the company generated 70 million birr with 41 percent increase while the investment income has also grown. the investment income mainly incorporated via interest and other investments contributed 28 million birr and 46 million birr respectively.
before tax and after expenses the insurance firm earned 51 million birr which is an increase from 37 million birr in 2016/17 fiscal year.
the company’s net profit after tax will be 44 million birr which is a high amount of growth when compared with 35 million birr a year ago.
the earnings per share have reached at 25 percent with 19 percent growth, according to the president of africa insurance.
the insurance sector has been dominated by the central market that the addis ababa premium collection is taken 70 percent of the sector and the balance is goes to regions.
the class of business that dominate the sector is motor, which is at some point enforced by the government in related with third party and also the accidents alerts the society to be insured.
due to reduction of construction in the year the engineering class of business and pecuniary has reduced, while it has showed some growth. in related with the hard currency shortage the marine insurance business has declined at the stated period. the situation has forced the sector more stiff and competing between the insurers on price.
kiros, who is the former head of the association of ethiopian insurers, says that lack of awareness in the society means that the county has not been able to collect the required premiums proportional to the population and the economy. he thinks insurance companies need to become more creative in developing products and raising awareness. he also wants the government to help promote and undertake studies via actuaries to expand the life insurance business, which is common in other parts of the world. “insurance companies may focus on the short term target to make a profit but the government can look at the big picture,” he added.
the premiums collected by insurers is considered one of the major sources for investments, however it is limited when it comes to ethiopia because the sector has not been growing. kiros says that his company is one of the top three private insurers excluding the state giant ethiopian insurance corporation which dominated the sector at 35 percent in terms of premium market share.
kiros claimed that his company’s assets have grown to over one billion birr. for the current year the company will move its headquarters a building which has 12 stories and thee additional basements for parking which was constructed at a cost of 160 million birr in the japan area at african avenue (bole road). the company also has a building at bisrate gabriel which cost 200 million birr."
"ethiopia has seen the highest number of people forced to flee their homes within their country in the first half of 2018, according a report by the international displacement monitoring center (idmc).
according to the 2018 global report on internal displacement, conflict has uprooted some 1.4 million ethiopians from their homes since the start of the year, according to the report. this has been largely due to ethnic clashes in gedeo and west guji region in southern ethiopia, and continued violence in the oromia-somali border region.
“it is sad that 1.4 million people fleeing violence isn’t making global headlines. the world has turned a blind eye to ethiopia,” warned nigel tricks, regional director of the norwegian refugee council (nrc). “families we’ve met who have fled fighting are living in dire conditions, and dismal international funding is being channeled to help them.”
the report points out that the government and aid agencies are working hard to respond, but with around one million newly displaced people in gedeo and west guji sheltering with host communities and in overcrowded communal shelters, food provision, water and health services are stretched beyond capacity. the affected area was already one of the most densely populated parts of ethiopia, with the influx of people now doubling the population in some areas. the current rainy season is also worsening peoples’ living conditions and hindering the humanitarian response.
“people tell us they are keen to return home, but they fled with nothing and need to know they can access support to rebuild their lives. it’s important that any returns are voluntary and sustainable. families must also be confident of the safety of areas before moving back,” said tricks.
violence also continued to flare in the oromia-somali border region, with 200,000 people fleeing their homes in the first half of the year. another 500,000 people fled clashes in the last quarter of 2017. nearly all areas along the regional border have been affected. the region has been hard hit by food shortages, which has compounded the crisis.
according to the idmc, with 30.6 million internal displacements in 2017, which is the equivalent of 80,000 people displaced each day, it’s time for an honest conversation, led by affected countries and with support from the international community, on the most effective ways to turn the tide on internal displacement."
"the large tax payers office (lot) of the ethiopian revenue and customs authority (erca) froze the liquid assets of the well know chinese construction firm because they owe nearly four billion birr in back taxes.
erca has asked china communications construction company (cccc) ltd, to settle profit tax and other related sums amounting to over 3.9 billion birr. sources said that the construction firm has agreed to pay the tax but has not done so on time.
hirut mebrate, head of the branch office, told capital that the lot has frozen the assets of the fortune 500 company.
“they were given a month to settle the required sum which is what the law stipulates, but the deadline passed on tuesday. as a result, the tax authority is responsible for taking action to collect the money so we have frozen their assets,” she added.
according to hirut, the company is expected to settle the accrued profit tax, reverse taxation, withholding and vat for the last two years.
hirut said that the accounts the company held in several accounts were frozen as of the middle of the week.
cccc, which was also known as china road and bridge corporation (crbc), is one of the oldest chinese construction firms involved in ethiopian business. it has been well known for projects it runs like the capital city’s first ever ring road which began in 1998 and consumed usd 98 million. it has also engaged in the first toll road of addis-adama at a cost of usd 800 million. currently the company has projects including the usd 345 million bole international airport expansion project besides the 220 km woldiya-mekelle electrified rail project.
recently china civil engineering construction corporation ltd (ccecc), the other chinese construction giant settled a bill with erca of over 446 million birr after the authority accused the company of forging receipts and evading taxes."
"thousands of people from the meche woreda, around arbamnich, destroyed thousands of hectares of forest during two confrontations. around 700 people were damaging the park until the security forces hampered the destruction. on the next day many residents came back and destroyed more property.
the individuals who deforested the park said they were allowed to live there and that the regional heads gave them permission.
the day before this occurred, representatives from the ethiopian wildlife conservation authority (ewca) held talks with residents after reports of threats from park administrators. the southern nations nationalities and peoples region (snnpr) reported to ewca that it conducted research indicating there are 101 hectares of land outside the park. the zonal, woreda and regional government parties talked about the issue and formed a committee consisting of nine individuals to study the problem and list findings.
however, just after the federal team left the city several buses transporting residents came to the area. they got off and went to the park and spent six hours destroying it. the federal police, national defense force and regional special forces came in to stabilize the situation around noon, according to shemeles zenebe, head of the park. the area under attack was near the park office.
regional representatives said that the eastern part of the park was invaded by multiple farmers from the oromiya region.
the staff managing the park says that even if there is no area ratified by the house of peoples representatives (hpr), there is a demarcation of 514sqm, inside the park’s jurisdiction.
“we didn’t find any wildlife killed yet but a large amount of forest is destroyed,” said shemels.
the region ordered police to release suspects under the police custody, said solomon. “the suspects were those who transported people from various locations to the park in the early morning and police have credible evidence to arrest them”, he added. “we used to believe the region was part of the solution until its latest act of directly ordering the security forces to release people.”
“if the claims from the snnp that there are many farmers residing in the park illegally are true then the solution is not doing the same thing over and over instead we should work to save the life of the forest,”  said solomon. “resource competition can harm the country and the local population as well.”
after the last destruction happened the federal government communicated to the regional government to halt the problem, which finally led the zonal cabinet gathering to address the problem.
the park which is located between the oromia regional state and the snnp is known for zebras and giraffes.
“the situation is under control but a lot of damage has been left behind,” said shemeles. “there should be sustainable measures put in place to solve the crisis,” he told capital."
"according to the addis ababa city fire, emergency prevention and rescue agency’s annual report, 83 people were killed in the city from floods and fires. holes from construction sites contributed to another 88 people being injured. flooding and fires damaged many shops and homes causing a loss of 408.4 million birr.
in total there were 535 floods and fires this fiscal year. this included the fire that damaged 140 shops near the grand anwar mosque in mercato causing 57 million birr in property damage.
two weeks ago a pregnant woman and her two children drowned when they were trapped by flood waters while washing clothes by a river in asko. police have yet to find their bodies.
poor safety management of construction sites means that floods are increasing according to the report. bole sub- city, one of the most affluent places, had 83 incidents while adiss ketema and kolfe had 65 and 64 accidents respectively.
in the previous fiscal year 531 accidents occurred in the city, snatching the lives of 83 people  and injuring 119. negatu mulu, communications officer told capital that helicopters and boats should be purchased because they could be used to save lives.
“two weeks ago there were floods in akaki and it took hours to borrow boats and helicopters from defense forces and later the helicopters came but we did not manage to rescue people and finally our rescue workers swam and saved the people’s lives. if we had a helicopter and boats we could manage our service when big fires occur.”
a recent study by the agency disclosed that 121,000 households across all sub- cities and 1,000 government and private institutions are vulnerable to flood disasters. the study identified 143 places as high risk and stated that if the necessary relocation or reconstruction is not made soon disasters may kill thousands and damage 4.5 billion birr in property. many of the risky places are found in gullele and nifas silke sub city where there are homes near river and drainage sites.
riversides in addis ababa have been a source of worry for residents. they have been dogged by landslides, pollution and lack of development for ages. but due to a spate of development activities, that might change soon.
the research found that addis ababa rivers and riversides face problems which include: badly polluted segments through direct discharge of domestic waste generated mainly from households and institutions; river bank erosion; and inaccessible rivers and riversides."
"commercial and small scale farming is killing fish in lake ziway.
the 31km long and 20km wide lake faces a critical decrease of fish production as farmers use the lakes water for irrigation.
19.3 million cubic meters of water pumped per annum for  livestock, domestic, irrigation, commercial farms and construction. the water is estimated to be worth over usd 89 million.  however the farms are not being charged for taking water from the lake. form the pumped water 54.1 % is being taken by commercial farms growing flowers and grapes near the lake while 31% is taken for small scale farming.
the recent study conducted for the ministry of environment reports that the lake’s annual fish production has decreased to 1,000 tons from 3,500 tons. this has occurred as the lake’s depth has decreased to four meters from twelve.
this has caused fish to die off and some species to become extinct. previously the lake had 12 species of fish. now that number is down to three; the carassius, catfish and tilapia.
meanwhile overfishing is occurring at the lake as beach seines, gillnets and loglines, used for fishing, disturb the fish.
if that were not enough, chemical waste is being thrown in bulk from the farms to the lake as over 8,000 trap fish to eat in the lake.
over 18,300 people bathe in the lake and 5,158 boats trips are carried out per year.
the report states: the major cause for the accelerated water quality changes in the lake were identified as human impact in the catchment of the lake. this includes land use changes, particularly removal of vegetation cover, irrigation, diversion of inflows and industrial use of the water which have caused a decline in water quality and quantity directly impacting the current change in fish composition and abundance. therefore, sustainable utilization and conservation measures should be taken. in lake ziway, large numbers of small sized fish of all species are being exploited and proper management actions are required to protect the immature fish. particularly, the size of the captured stock should be determined taking in to consideration the size at first maturity of fishes.
a  swift ecosystem payment service and tight regulation should be applied to reduce the  discharge of  toxic chemicals into the lake.  many pumps are abstracting freshwater from the lake including commercial farms. even during the rainy season water for horticultural crops is collected from the lake. hence, the current irrigation practices in the upstream areas have considerably reduced the volume of the inflowing water from the meki and ketar river and the lake itself, critically impacting the water level of lake ziway. as a result, the lake ecosystem is being affected by catchment degradation, siltation, and imbalance between water inflow and outflow."
"gangs armed with guns and knives are repeatedly robbing 40/60 condo projects which are close to completion.
just this last month over ten robberies occurred at condo sites located in bole bulbula, hayat and megenagna sites; places where over 5,000 houses are being built. the bandits came at night and stole over one million birr worth of electrical wire and steel.
when capital visited a condominium site in megenagna known as ‘tourist site’ last wednesday a store key had been cut and over 300,000 birr of electric wire was stolen from it.
meaza asrat a store keeper at tourist site told capital that a group of gang members came in a mini bus, cut the key with saw and stole the electric wire.
“the guard told us that a group of people came with car and flashed a light in the guards faces so they couldn’t  identified the men who were behind the crime and then the gangs broke into the store and stole the wire and put it in their car and drove off.’’
she added that the gangs come twice a week and that the police don’t stop them even though they have reported the robberies.
another engineer at the same site told capital one of the guards was injured trying to stop the gangs from entering.
in a mid-week press conference the addis ababa police commission said robbery is widespread in the city and majority of the crimes are committed by people who were recently released from prison.
the commission advised residents to expose the gangs to the police.
in related news vice mayor of addis ababa, takele uma who visited the 40/60 condo projects said the finished houses will be transferred to beneficiaries till the end of october.
he urged site engineers to finish the projects on time.
the site engineers expressed concern that electric power and some input materials are in short supply which makes it difficult for them to do their job properly. takele promised his administration  will work tirelessly to overcome their challenges.
recently capital reported that the addis ababa saving house development enterprise is in discussions with the commercial bank of ethiopia (cbe) to transfer 17,000 condos which are in the verge of being completed in gerji, bole bulebula, hayat  meri and summit.
apparently   the enterprises have the responsibility to accomplish all the construction of the homes   but to answer the high demand of the beneficiaries the finishing work might be transferred if cbe agrees."
"yet another company has been victimized by the hard currency shortage. prominent aluminum cookware manufacturer kaluworks ethiopia plc, has shut their doors. despite being in business for two decades they were recently doomed by lack of inputs.
the hard currency shortage has significantly affected general industry and particularly heavy industry.
a source told capital that, kaluworks, who was producing non-ferrous metals, has been closed for the past several weeks and to unable to run production which damaged them economically. experts said that the problem at kaluworks is an example of how serious the forex problem is.
solomon mulugeta, general manager of the ethiopian association of basic metals and engineering industries (eabmei), said event though the company is not a member of the association, they have information about the challenge it faces.
he said that the closure is a big indication that the entire manufacturing sector is faces an alarming problem. “we have recommended that the gaps seen in terms of giving priority to foreign currency. every sector needs hard currency but needs to give priority and quotas to some of the significant sectors,” solomon said.
many sectors are interlinked, according to the association head. forex policy must address this fact another expert said.
the manufacturing sector actors claimed that there is not clarity in terms of hard currency allocation. they stated that the government needs to have a clear process about the approval of letter of credit (lc).
even thought the national bank of ethiopia (nbe), issued a directive that private banks must allocate 40 percent of their hard currency for manufacturing industry experts claimed that it is not clear in terms of priority within the manufacturing industry itself.
furthermore, a few months ago nbe amended the directive no. rel/05/2002, ‘external loan and supplier’s credit directives’ that only allow foreign based companies to import input on credit. the local based industries have strongly criticized the decision that they claim goes against the government’s policy to boost local investment.
recently representatives from ethiopia’s manufacturing industry claim that a shortage of hard currency has led them to produce under their capacity which has caused a chain reaction where production costs have risen, prices have increased and the economy has slowed down.
the nation’s forex shortage over the last few years has seriously affected private sector activity. this has not only negatively affected import businesses in all areas, but especially the manufacturing sector with its small scale businesses and heavy industries.
in the past, to address the problem the state owned financial giant commercial bank of ethiopia (cbe) allocated a limited amount of hard currency so the manufacturing industry could import inputs and spare parts.
in march ceb allocated usd 300 million to the manufacturing sector, which is very small. in march 2017 cbe released about usd 1 billion which is still very limited but better in comparison with the current year’s allocation, according to industrialists.
the metal industry, which is a major employer with 100 thousand jobs needs about usd four billion per annum for optimum production, according to the ministry of industry.
lemma teklehaimanot, partial owner of kaluworks declined to comment but  according to sources, the owners are looking to sell the property.
kaluworks ethiopia is owned by kenya’s kaluworks and lemma’s lica plc. it used to be a major employer. it was also the oldest with 21 years of operation and the biggest company in the sector.
sources at the company said that production capacity has grown to 150 tons per month, but just to sustain itself it should produce from 70 to 80 tons per month. “however this has not been happening consistently,” a source said.
“the hard currency problem that has been going on for around three years has caused companies to  consume their own capital,” a source explained."
"the government via its financial giant, commercial bank of ethiopia (cbe), has released highly anticipated hard currency to the manufacturing industry. however, it’s less than what is needed, capital has learnt.
sources close to the industry disclosed that last week the state bank sent the letter of credit (lc).
according to the information capital obtained, the sum of usd 500 million has been released for those engaged in the industrial sector. sources said this time around the lc was not available for finished goods importers.
the latest release is the second time within almost six months after the usd 300 million was approved in march.
even though this is a positive first step usd half a billion is much smaller than the demand, according to sources.
experts in heavy industry told capital that the amount is relatively high compared with the march disbursement; but it is still very small compared with the expectation and may be used to import a limited amount of inputs for several weeks of production with up to 20 percent production capacity.
in march 2017 and a year before the bank released about one and two billion usd respectively to fill the demand of the industry but the latest trend indicates that the amount has declined.
the shortage of hard currency has forced manufacturers to operate at 10 to twenty percent capacity.
some of the companies have also closed their industry due to insufficient hard currency access. “the situation has forced business to close and some are just paying salary to employees,” an industrialist, who wanted to be anonymous said. “the industrialists want to fire their employees but are afraid of the community, who may become angry about the situation and damage the factories,” he added.
the production cost has also increased because manufacturers are fully employing people but making less, according to experts. finished goods importers have taken advantage of this since they are selling products at higher rates but importing similar products at cheaper rates, experts said.
even though the national bank of ethiopia issued a directive a few years ago forcing  banks to allocate hard currency on a first come first serve basis and an additional directive on allocated 40 percent of the hard currency for the manufacturing sector this is not often followed by private banks.
experts said that currently the business community is focusing on importing finished goods. “if you see the cargo containers  in djibouti now almost all are finished goods and even the coming vessels are loaded with finished material, which is a trend that was seen about 15 years ago,” an expert in the manufacturing industry claimed. relatively exporters have better options to get hard currency but most of them are importing finished products, experts claimed. they add that this harms the manufacturing industry.
recently the ministry of industry has asked manufacturers to come up with their demand and real production capacity, because the current allocation is far from what is needed.
prime minister abiy ahmed (phd), recently secured usd one billion in cash from uae and has worked to get more foreign currency by combating illegal exchanges."
"the black market exchange rate has rebounded and is now going up after a decline to near bank rates during the last month.
starting june 30 after some major actions taken by prime minister abiy ahmed (phd) the exchange rate on the black market slightly decreased from its record 36 percent difference with the bank rate, which is currently around 27.5 birr to one usd. after the pm’s announcement that the government would take actions against illegal trading and pleas for the public to exchange money in banks, trading on the black market almost disappeared temporarily.
dealers at the illegal market told capital that the rate is now reviving. they say it is now around 32 birr per one usd which is almost 17.2 percent higher from the legal market or about a 4.7 birr difference. illegal exchange dealers, who refused to be named, said they don’t make decisions about the exchange rate.
“we raise the rate based on the recommendation from secondary collectors who take orders from tertiary collectors,” the dealers told capital.
“based on the orders from final collectors we come up with a rate and it has now reached to about 32 birr,” they said.
in addis the major primary hard currency collection centers are located around beherawi (gandhi), american gibi (merkato), bole and bole michael.
the business is highly based on trust.
according to experts the rate went down because of the crackdown on the contraband business which was occurring in the eastern part of the country. most foreign currency travels out of ethiopia’s eastern border but some flies out of the airport. often legal importers use the illegal collected hard currency to import products when they have a hard time getting currency legally, according to experts.
the current increase indicates that to some extent new contraband routes  are being opened and at the same time illegal traders have figured out how to get around check points at the border or the airport, experts said.
“at the same time the hard currency shortage has not improved so things will return to business as usual and we will see similar trends that occurred before july,” experts said. the government will continue to try and stop illegal trading even though it may be difficult to fully cut, according to experts.
before the government devaluated the birr by 15 percent on october 11, 2017 the black market rate stood around 27 birr for a usd. immediately after the devaluation, however, it escalated to 33 birr. for a long time it was about 25 percent higher than the legal market. however, in the past few months the parallel market frequently increased and the gap with the bank rate widened up to 36 percent and stood the fdi also buy hard currency from the black market.
when the pm announced that his government would take action against the illegal business more people exchanged with local banks and over usd 100 million was collected in the past few weeks. on the other hand at the airport and somali border region there has been a large amount of illegally transported hard currency.  for instance according to recent reports a significant amount of foreign and local currency was confiscated at the bole airport."
"the addis ababa trade bureau reports that some bakeries are selling bread at a lower weight than the regulations allow. after a recent two month inspection of bakeries, some shops have been selling bread which is supposed to be 100 grams at as little as 60 grams to increase their profit. 100 grams of bread is supposed to be sold for 1 birr and 30 cents. bread that was supposed to weight 200 or 300 grams has had its weight reduced by 80 grams during the baking process. so far seven bakeries have been closed for lowering the weight and the bureau says more may be shut as they are warning all trade regulation bureaus in every sub city.
a scarcity of wheat is being blamed for the recent behavior of bakery owners. bread prices doubled from one to two birr at bakeries which were not receiving subsidized flour from the government. a quintal of wheat is being sold to bakers for 2,000 birr, twice its recent 1,000 birr a quintal price. at some places bread prices have gone higher than two birr.
kasehun abera, trade inspection head at the bureau told capital that the government has a zero tolerance policy toward lowering the weight of bread.
“the wheat flour the bakeries get is subsidized by the government. the main reason we do this is to help our people. we have observed that some bakeries are using the wheat shortage as a pretext for lowering bread weight. but they can’t add price or lower weight without the government’s permission. these bad activities  hurt consumers and give the city a bad image.”
he added the wheat scarcity is currently being solved  and government is distributing wheat to flour companies who give it to bakeries.
currently 400,000 quintals of wheat are under the procurement process and 700,000 quintals of wheat went to flour companies and bakeries in the last two months.
a source in the trade bureau said that the government should get out of the wheat supply market  to stabilize the bread market in the city.
“bread weight in the city is not uniform because some bakeries get a subsidy and some do not but if the supply of wheat fully falls to the private sector competition will be created among suppliers to provide the best product at a good price which ultimately will benefit consumers and bakeries to obtain better prices and services.’’
currently 1,650 bakeries get flour subsidies in addis ababa through 44 wheat flour companies who are working on the outskirts of addis ababa. under normal circumstances addis ababa gets 168,000 quintals of wheat from the ethiopian grain trade enterprise."
"the board of directors of the ethiopian electric power (eep) removed azeb asnake (eng), ceo of eep from her position, sources told capital.on its meeting held on wednesday august 22, the board chaired by girma biru (amb) who recently replaced debretsion gebremichael (phd), has announced to the management of eep that azeb will be removed. she has not yet received an official letter.the first ceo of eep since the split of ethiopian electric power corporation in to two will be replaced by a new ceo. sources told capital that abraham belay (phd), director of the cyber technology engineering institute with insa, is the one said that will take up the reign of eep.according to sources, other top managements will also be replaced shortly.  this is in line with the current reform the government is undertakingazeb has been on the position since 2013 and before that she led the gibe iii, the biggest power plant in the country with 1,870 mw generation capacity, as a project manager."
"ethio-telecom decides to minimize tariff frehiwot tamiru, ceo of ethio-telecom, disclosed today august 22, 2018 that the telecom price will be slashed by 40% on local calls,45% on sms,43% on internet service and 54% on broadband internet."
"the ministry of finance and economic cooperation (mofec) announced 50 potential projects for (mofec) public-private partnerships (ppp). they are currently undergoing detailed study with support from the world bank group (wbg).
haji ibsa, communication director for mofec told capital that finishing structural and legal frameworks for ppp were one of the things the ministry was most successful in this past fiscal year.
“among the 50 projects, 26 are in the final stages and international bids will be announced soon,” haji said.
“contract performances in ethiopia are among major problems we face,” haji expressed during the press briefing at the ministry. “lack of enough research prior to starting a project and less bargaining power costs the government.”
the director exemplified the low performance of the metals and engineering corporation (metec) with a fertilizer factory it took on 2012 with usd 540 million. china national complete plant import & export corporation (complant) offered usd 730 million to complete the project within 5 years. metec proposed to finalize the project within three years. haji pointed out that this is a huge difference that should have been more thoroughly researched.
complant oversaw the design, manufacture, supply, transportation to site, site preparation, installation, supervision, commissioning, training of personnel and other responsibilities at the yayu industrial complex.
“the complex was supposed to be finished long ago but the performance is below 50 percent,” he said. “the contract also has defects including making clear who is responsible for the deficient work,” said haji.
the past 12 months witnessed continuous inflation which challenged the economy, according to the report.
in the last fiscal year, export earnings showed a usd 78.9 million decline (2.8%).
imports increased by usd 24.6 billion compared to the same period last year. in the 2016/17 fiscal year the total paid amount for imports was usd 30.1 billion which increased to usd 55.5 billion.
the federal government’s income in 2017/18 was at 76.1% in comparison with the plan. in the last fiscal year, the government was able to generate 108.6 billion birr from tax and non-tax revenues, while the plan was to generate 237 billion birr.
due to the high budget deficit, the ministry postponed some mega project payments until the next fiscal year, according to haji. the 2017/18 fiscal year saw a 53.8 billion birr budget gap which is going to be transferred to the current fiscal year.
tax revenue has not grown at the pace of economic development which has pushed the government to look for loans to fill the budget gap. the report shows such actions affect the private sector especially when it comes to obtaining loans.
the ministry hopes to increase revenue by improving tax policy.
“there are going to be tax reforms in the coming fiscal year,” according to the report.
audit gaps, loans, and excessive expenditures were listed reasons for the poor fiscal performance and marked as critical problems to be addressed.
another issue was funding for youth programs.  in the past fiscal year, 7.8 billion birr was transferred to youth but not every region used all their funding, according to the report."
"at the request of prime minster abiy amhed (phd) the number of ministries will be cut to 16 when parliament returns from recess at the beginning of october, capital has learned.
relevant sources stated that several ministry offices are engaged in restructuring and mergers after a recommendation from the prime minister. under this new arrangement the number of state ministers will increase and work under some ministry offices.
excluding the deputy pm and speaker of the house of peoples’ representatives currently there are 28 cabinet members including the ethiopian revenues and customs authority, attorney general, commissioner of national planning and chief government whip.
a source told capital that the pm wants to have just 16 ministries and during his recent us tour he asked if any other country in the world had the number of ministries ethiopia has.  he pointed out that this costs the government a lot of money and creates redundancy in job responsibilities. the pm also said that in some cases the tasks an agency undertakes are not enough to justify a ministry and instead can be handled under several larger ministries.
one expert agreed with the pm saying that enormous resources are allocated for a single minister including allocating three vehicles with drivers and other position benefits.
“however, if the position is at the state minister level the cost is reduced and becomes much more reasonable,” a source said. cabinet level positions are challenging to manage since it takes unnecessary time for the head of government. reducing the council of ministers should make governing more efficient, the source added.
according to sources, some of the ministries up for dissolution include the ministry of federal affairs and pastoral area development, which would be divided under the ministry of agriculture and natural resources and the ethiopian national security agency. some others like the ministry of industry and the mining sector are also expected to supervised by other departments.
when he was first appointed the pm moved the ministry of livestock and fishery, which was recently separated from ministry of agriculture, under the ministry of agriculture and natural resources.capital’s effort to talk ahmed shide, minister of government communication affairs office, fitsum arega, chief of staff at the pm office, was unfruitful."
"most national parks and lakes in ethiopia are in grave danger and may even dry up or become extinct, according to the ethiopian wildlife conservation authority (ewca).
among the 13 parks the authority administers, ones with endangered species such as the babile elephant sanctuary (bes) and sinkile species sanctuary are in danger of the most tragic ends.
bes is home to the horn of africa’s only surviving elephants, loxodonta africana. however, according to elephant action plan, there are only 350 elephants living there and the population is declining rapidly.
one major problem facing ethiopia’s national parks face is the many pastoralists who live on them and use the land for cattle grazing. nech-sar national park (nnp) is one example and abiyata shalla national park is also being threatened because there are 5,000 people living there, according to girma timer, director of wildlife protection at the authority.
“there is an increasing number of people and cattle competing for resources,” zerihun tefera (phd), biodiversity specialist told capital.
illegal fishing on the arbaminch side of nnp is affecting chamo lake, causing it to rapidly narrow, according to girma. meanwhile neighboring abaya lake, is swallowing its surrounding area because it is also being affected by upper streams carrying eroded soil and increasing the water level.
“the ecological catastrophe will affect our lives and everyone should work to solve the problem, not only the authority,” he told capital. “we are paying a sacrifice for deforestation and soil erosion.”
bale national park is said to be a model for demarcation and establishment of legal protection. according to ewca the park has in place a ten-year road map to solve the crisis of pastoralists living in the park and using the land for cattle grazing. there are an estimated one million cattle in bale national park.
ewca is focusing on policies like this in other parks as well as it has recently hired new managers, girma said.
they are trying to establish park boundaries, establish the ability to enforce laws, and undertaking structural and institutional reform in collaboration with german aid agency, g.i.z.he admitted that previous relationship between the authority and the parks was ineffective but said they are working to change this. sometimes there is also not a clear understanding between local and federal administrations over park rules.
“we have agreed with the localities about the importance conserving wildlife and the park and we will progressively move people living in the park off the land,” girma said. “we want every park and conservation area to follow suit.”
there are 27 parks in ethiopia, 14 of which are administered by the regional governments. parks become national when they exist between two regional governments and are registered as a global heritage or when they are trans-boundary.
in trans-boundary parks, residents of neighboring countries can include foreign pastoralists looking for water and grass or dwelling in the parks along the border area until the dry season is over.
zerihun tefera (phd), biodiversity specialist, recommends developing a project to conserve natural resources. he gave the example of abiyata lake which is rapidly decreasing in volume due to potash production, which is water intensive.
“the government must be serious about the environmental impact assessments done not as a mere formality but as a life line of the ecosystem,” he advocated.
“the nation lost the most diverse ecology in the lakes including artic birds which migrate to abiyata every winter. we have completely lost the pelicans and flamingos are at their lowest numbers ever. there is also a tremendous loss of fish and other wildlife in the lakes, and similar phenomena is occurring in the babile elephant sanctuary.”
“the problem must be taken seriously before it gets out of hand,” zelalem pleaded."
"a road construction project passing through lalibela has been delayed after residents destroyed equipment and a camp the construction company was staying in.
the 98.7km long gashena-lalibela-sekota road was supposed to make it easier for tourists to access the highly popular rock-hewn churches of lalibela but residents complained that the road was falling apart and a bridge in lalibela had already washed out.
cccc first highway engineering c.o. ltd a state-owned chinese enterprise, which also constructed adama expressway and other roads in ethiopia was responsible for building the road.
however, two weeks ago residents of lalibela town attacked the camp, according to the city’s deputy mayor, hayle negate. police are investigating and attempting to locate the vandals, but for now the company has left the site.
the mayor said there were other problems with the project which led the ethiopian roads authority (era), to change consultants.
“the residents were also angry because the company brought its own (chinese) employees from another construction site instead of employing local residents, which they were expecting. they also are upset because of the low quality and class of the road,” said haile.
“we, the leaders and the localities agree on our pervious request of asphalt concrete (ac) and we have presented this request to era as well.”
the mayor also told capital he doubts they will be able to repair the road.  a new consultant has promised the streaming company they will build the existing road.
according to procurement specification the road should be finished in 3.5 years. since it began in 2015 this means it should have been finished by mid-2019. the road was expected to be constructed as a class ds4 meaning it would have a double surface concrete treatment and a cross section of 10m.
however, the northern wollo zone culture and tourism bureau head, getahun kassa, did not want the road to be concrete.
“as the rock-hewn churches are registered in the unesco world heritage the comfort of the tourist must meet their expectation,” he told capital. “the previous gravel road is better than what is being constructed,” he said.
the lalaibela rock-hewn churches have brought in over 81,000 foreign tourists and more than one million domestic visitors.
“most tourists who visit ethiopia will usually come to lalaibela. that’s why making this destination accessible is crucial for the nation and improves the livelihoods of the people,” said getahun.
era went to the place last week and replaced the consultants, according to getahun.
samson wondmu, communication director, told capital that the road has not been handed over to era yet and if there is a quality problem era will not approve it. he also said that the damage occurred due to heavy rains.
“we want the project to resume but we want the quality to improve. we hope the company will correct the issues raised by the community,” the city deputy mayor told capital."
"lidetu says he will not form a new party until the election board is reorganized.
“emotional people still send me death threats,” he added.
lidetu ayalew, says he is disappointed that the ethiopian democratic party broke away but told capital that he doesn’t plan to form a new one until the national election board of ethiopia reorganizes itself honestly.
edp dissolved after 25 years due to infighting.
“like any other party there were misunderstandings among members but we managed to overcome them but the sad part is that neb sided with members who tried to sabotage our work and then one of those individuals handle our bank accounts which goes against the nation’s laws,” he said.
“we will wait until trust is established with a new election board,” he said.
when capital asked about his future he said:
“politics is my sole but i need time to think and would like for a calmer atmosphere to be established, for example when i was at a forum in mekele people insulted me and threatned to burn my party and even kill me.”
he thinks that opposition parties should take advantage of the new climate in ethiopia to unify and work together because this was one of the reasons they were previously ineffective.
lidetu played a leading role in bringing about the limited rights opposition parties enjoyed leading to the 2005 ethiopian election. he left the federal parliament as he did not win a seat. in 2011, he left the presidency of edp to mushe semu since his party’s regulation does not allow one person to hold presidency more than two consecutive periods (eight years)."
"thousands of local residents destroyed a gemstone mining extraction site managed by web gemstone mining plc (wgm) at the waqille woreda, web kebele of borena zone, last tuesday.
wgm had been exploring for the precious stone in the area for the past three years and was in the last stages of evaluating the resource, according to manoj gaur, general manager of wgm in ethiopia.
the uk based company also has a presence on the south african stock exchange and is known for mining and marketing colored gemstones globally.
wgm said they invested around five million usd at the destroyed site over the past three years for exploration, according to the general manager.
he told capital that he and other professionals escaped the area fearing violent acts during the end of june when police stepped in.
wgm also has mines in zambia, mozambique, and madagascar.
a worker at the site told capital that thousands of people invaded the office, residential camps and the store house and that everything was violently destroyed. “the safe boxes and extracted samples were all compromised,” he said.
“we don’t know the exact damage now as no one can enter the area, but we are worried that if the essential documents are destroyed it will be difficult for our re-operation,” said manoj.
“local residents raised questions a few months earlier which the regional administrators came to resolve,” he said.
they wanted infrastructure built which the company promised to do. they were frustrated because they felt that it took over 11 years for the company to evaluate the site and inaugurate extraction, which they felt was too long.
the company said that it has only been there since 2015 and it was on the verge of finishing the exploration. the public was confused because there were previous projects conducted at the area and they assumed wgm was there for more than a decade.
the general manager said the company was providing community services for the residents including sharing its water every day. previously wgm shared their clinic with residents and created over 100 jobs.
“we were working in a total peace with the community before the situation changed suddenly, and when we reached the extraction stage there have been even more jobs,” said manoj. “that’s how we do business globally and also we work in an environmentally friendly way, for example, we only use water to purify the bulk sample of the mineral.”
some residents took to the streets the same day showing their opposition to the action, according to the zone administrator.
wgm was planning to extract the stone and export it to the global auction market. they are conducting an exploration study on 200sqm of land in attempts of finding 27km of potential emerald-mineralized area."
"semegnew bekele (eng.) (53) head of the grand ethiopia renaissance dam (gerd) will be laid to rest today sunday july 29 at the holy trinity church.
the engineer in charge of the country’s flagship electricity project has been found dead at meskel square on thursday morning.
the body of simegnew bekele was found in his car parked at meskel square. police have opened investigations into the possible cause of death and confirmed that he was dead by a gun shot.
the gerd is set to become africa’s largest hydro dam with a capacity of 6,450 mw when completed.
ethiopians all over the country have been expressing shock and sadness at the incident.
ethiopia despite the breeze of a new political order which is expanding the political space is also facing security headaches in parts of the country. it has led the united states to openly call for the need to maintain the peace in these delicate times.
a series of arsons have been recorded in a number of prisons across the country whiles there is a bulging humanitarian crisis in the face of displacements from communal conflicts in some areas.
the most high-profile death till date occurred in may 2018 when the authorities set of to investigate the circumstances under which the country manager of dangote cement was killed by unknown assailants.
at a time when the country was still under a state of emergency, the command post in charge of security said deep kamara the manager was killed along with two other individuals in the attack.
the command post at the time said it was hunting for the attackers and called on the local community to cooperate with security forces to help apprehend the criminals.
about gerd
ethiopia stated earlier this year that the project was going well and expected to start partial test power generation soon. it is a major part of a massive energy infrastructure project the ethiopian government is undertaking which aims to see the country’s power generation capacity increase from the current 4,280 mw to 17,300 mw by 2020.
the ethiopian government has embarked on massive energy projects across the country with a view to succeeding in its plans to make the east african country a light industry hub in africa and a middle-income economy by 2025.
gerd, whose construction started in april 2011, is being built at a cost of 4.7 billion u.s. dollars, fully financed from domestic resources and is expected to have a reservoir with a total of 74 billion cubic meters of water upon completion.
the hydro dam, which is being built on blue nile river 40 km from sudanese border, has been billed as a landmark project signaling ethiopia’s renaissance.
it has however been the center of a dragging diplomatic standoff between ethiopia and sudan on one hand and egypt on the other hand. egypt fears the usd 4.7 billion dam, that the horn of africa nation is building on the nile, will reduce a water supply vital for its 84 million people, who mostly live in the nile valley and delta."
"the workers association of the commercial bank of ethiopia (cbe) gathered last saturday to negotiate with the bank’s management about the ongoing disagreement over the new hr and organizational structure applied.
besides the banks promise to fix the problems in the implementation of the new structural change the association called the official meeting to get a grant from the bank. issues of revising the out dated salary adjustment and the respect of the collective agreement was raised in the meeting according to haimanot lemma, president of the association.
“we will have a council meeting this month which is going to officially give a warning to the bank and which will decide the deadline for the response” he told capital. “we will have a strike following the labor law of the country if the bank failed to resolve the complaint with the time limit.”
the 50 years old workers association of the bank included every employee of the bank except those who are at the managerial level. the president mentioned that over 29,000 employees of the bank are united with the questions raised.
the association also presents its questions to the office of the prime minister at the beginning of this month, according to haimanot.
the association was able to obtain the temporary ban of the reform which they are complaining to be implemented without salary listings.
the newly appointed manager of the bank who is referred as cooperative by the president was present at the meeting and promised the accelerated solution of the problem.
“we didn’t ask salary increment for the new structural change but it didn’t even include our previous salary” said himont lemma, the head of the association. “but, continuing with their previous salary wouldn’t be fair for the employees who are assigned to merged responsibilities”.
the current salary scale which was studied to serve for five years is expired according to haimanot.
the 99 members of the council who represent the every region of the bank will official announce the deadline.
the 75 years giant has more than 50,000 employees currently with its 1,240 branches and half a trillion birr total asset."
"this week pm abiy ahmed (phd) called for people to stop hoarding money at home and to shun the black market when exchanging hard currency. and it seems working. right after he announced that people flock to banks to exchange their foreign currency, some in support of the recent reform and some in fear of legal actions the government will take.during a presser following the three day visit of eritrean president isayas afeworqi, pm abiy appreciated the public’s hospitality during the events and then used the occasion to discuss steps to improve the country’s foreign exchange situation.prime minister abiy addressed two major issues, local currency being kept out of banks and hard currency being traded on informal markets.according to the financial law, banks have to report deposits greater than 200,000 birr to the ethiopia financial intelligence center.pm abiy called for banks to receive cash of any amount without any question and said the government would prosecute people who kept large amounts of cash at their homes.“i think the pm wants to stop people from keeping millions of birr in their home safes or business offices,” one banker said.“in my view keeping 100,000 birr at home isn’t that big of a deal but some people don’t use banks and keep millions of birr in their hands,” the banker continued.“we are now receiving a large amount of hard currency so i advise anyone who has foreign currency in their hands to exchange it via the legal market to avoid further damage,” abiy added.he did not elaborate what he meant by damage.the exchange rate on the black market has been volatile lately.in the past few months it escalated rapidly up to 37 birr and then declined recently.currently a dollar is exchanged at banks for 27.3 birr and on the black market for 27.5 to 27.8 birr.hopes are that pm abiy’s statements will help further alleviate the discontent between the informal market and the bank.market observers stated that about a week ago the parallel market rate dropped to 28.5 birr per usd from 37 birr.recently the pm which is very popular in every corner of the country,  invited the diaspora to remit money legally (through money transfer services) as opposed to using the black market, which has been observed to be one of the reasons for the hard currency shortage.other observers stated that the government has taken serious action and cut some of the strong networks in the contraband business chain which has reduced the appeal of trading currency illegally. "
"mamco paper products p.l.c. is considering closing doors after 24 years of making paper, toilet and soft tissue. the company which is affiliated with midroc said that lower quality products being passed off as its own are behind the problem. they have asked the government for help but to no avail.
“the company is planning to lay off many employees,” said mamco’s attorney.
research conducted last year by the company indicated that fake products are being distributed throughout ethiopia. they found fake products being sold by at least 11 shops in mercato.
their study showed fake and real products being sold alongside each other or presented as different categories of products.
ethiopian revenues and customs authority (erca) is losing a large amount of revenue from this giant illegal market chain because these illegal manufactures are not paying taxes. the distributors are also not giving receipts for the fake products, the research report stated.
the fake products are also said to have caused respiratory problems and tarnishing the company’s trademark, the report went on to say.
the chain of the forged products and the findings of the research were reported to the federal bureau of investigation (fbi), an investigation wing of the federal police, according to teka mahari, the company’s attorney.
“the bureau of investigation has only arrested three of the distributers,” said the attorney.
“police negligence has taken our last share of hope in finding the manufactures or staying in the market”.
the research team told capital that negligence of different parts of the government  bodies  is costing the nation a fortune and discouraging loyal investors.
“we do all the assignments for police and using the data we gave them as an informant, they could have traced the manufacturer,” the attorney told capital. “but they always complain about not having enough human resources for the intelligence and investigation team”.
“we have limited personnel working on intelligence but we are doing all we can to solve the crisis,” said commander  berhanu abate of the fbi’s trade competition and protection directorate director. “we are investigating the facts to find out the source”.
the company’s marketing manager refrained from disclosing the amount of damage caused to the company.
mamco which is the sister company of midroc was established in 1994 and produces toilet tissue, facial tissue, exercise books and napkin products."
"the private sector has blasted the economic challenges in the financial sector during a meeting with leaders of the national bank of ethiopia (nbe).
at the meeting that the ethiopian chamber of commerce and sectoral association (eccsa) and nbe organized on wednesday the private sector delivered its claim via chamber president melaku ezezew.
private businesspeople mainly the manufacturing and service industries described how difficult the hard currency shortage is for them.
melaku addressed other challenges too such as the under invoice practice and the black market. he says the illegal trading practices have expanded. “issuing receipts with a lower amount than the actual transaction pressures buyers and cheats the country out of tax revenue,” he said.
the hard currency shortage has forced producers to cut their production. some are waiting up to a year for hard currency to import spare parts worth less than usd 1,000.
some exporters who only want to obtain foreign currency are abusing the market by collecting major export items like coffee and sesame at a high price and selling them at a lower price or even a loss. “the central bank is familiar with this activity,” melaku said accusing the central bank of not being proactive in stopping it.
he also explained that the contraband market severely affects hard currency earnings. “for instance in the 2016/17 budget year the country exported 750,000 livestock, while djibouti and somalia who are receiving ethiopian livestock along the border area via contraband have exported seven million livestock during a similar period,” he said.
he complained that the country imports usd 1.6 billion worth of wheat and usd 650 million worth of edible oil which could instead be produced locally.
local investors also amplified that the suppliers’ credit scheme introduced early the past budget year for foreign direct investment, excluded local investors, who were working on import substitution.
“for us the only option for foreign currency is a letter of credit, while foreign direct investment and exporters are favored against the government policy,” investors complained.
the chamber president suggested that more alternatives besides letters of credit and suppliers’ credit should be available for accessing hard currency.
some investors felt that the development bank of ethiopia was unfair when it came to serving businesspeople. “we have seen agricultural investors access finance easily even though the government stated is prioritizing the manufacturing industry. however, we were unable to obtain a loan from the policy bank,” one participant said.
leaders in the manufacturing industry said private banks lack any real power since they are controlled by the central bank. they recommended that the government order leaders of banks to give priority to manufacturers when they want to import spare parts worth thousands of usd without consulting nbe or having to get a waiver from the central bank. “you have to give a limited mandate to the banks,” one of the participants added.
the business owners strongly argued that private banks are misusing the first come first serve scheme because they are giving priority to people importing end products and luxury commodities like whiskey and cosmetics as opposed to raw materials and medicine. the participants suggested opening up the market to foreign banks and starting a secondary market. others also suggested that citizens be allowed to have a foreign currency account like kenya has. some also criticized the role of the central bank, which they said was unclear.
manufacturing industry representatives asked the government to find ways to extend debt payments because manufacturing has been hindered by lack of inputs due to the shortage of hard currency.
the meeting was chaired by yinager dessie (phd), who was recently assigned governor of nbe. he said the central bank will be reformed but said the private sector must help by following the law.
“the private sector has to avoid illegal acts,” he said.  “there is misbehavior with regard to imports and exports; support us and we will support you,” he admonished.
in his response he addressed several of their issues recognizing that there is a challenge with under invoicing.
“we know who the affiliated company in china or dubai is,” he warned.
he recalled that the central bank started to work with the ethiopian revenue and customs authority in the import business and letter of credit approval. in the beginning of the past budget year nbe forced banks to approve a letter of credit equivalent to the price of the import items.
he hinted that nbe would establish an intelligence element to control illegal activity in the sector in addition to the banking supervision division, which controls the banking sector and gave hope that the government may consider the debt payment reschedule request. they have also studied a secondary market and plan to establish one in the future.
yinager said the government is studying how to stop the contraband trade, claiming that there are groups trying to gag the economy.
“the government will prosecute people trying to mess with the economy and trading in contraband,” he warned."
"a string of robberies continue to plague the ethiopian revenue and customs authority’s (erca) moyale branch.
for the past two weeks theft and property destruction have plagued the office, located on the border between ethiopia and kenya.
chanyalew haji, branch manager of the authority says last week they attempted to come up with a solution to the problem.
he said that the incidents began when eight vehicles were burned and two severely damaged by people throwing rocks. although the fire was later controlled by the national defense force and members of federal police, when security forces left larger groups came and looted the compound, stealing anything they could carry.
the building being used by erca also serves as a staff residence and a center for a new project called ‘one stop border’.
new infrastructure housing the one stop border project and equipment were taken away or damaged by the criminals, according to chanyalew.
“we cannot evaluate the destruction as we now fear for our security if we go to the store area,” he told capital.
“the situation now is not like what it was a year ago and it is beyond the capacity of the security forces in the area, we are worried about the safety of our staff.”
destruction and violent activities are still occurring at the erca building and the agency’s employees are being threatened.
“the branch office and the border are stable for now but no one is sure about what could possibly happen,” he added.
capital attempted to reach commissioner general melaku fenta of the federal police to comment on the issue but was unable to obtain a comment."
"the hard currency shortage is now causing a lack of paper for cash register machines. it has been about ten years since the country announced the use of cash register machines at selected businesses, the practice has widely spread throughout different parts of the country and businesses.
according to users that capital spoke, the absence of the cash register machine paper is affecting their daily business.
one of the sources, a businessman, that capital interviewed said that he is unable to buy products from the market due to lack of the machine paper.
“for my service business i buy bulk products from addis and sell in other parts  of the country, but in the past few weeks i have been struggling to buy products,” he said.
according to cash register machine law, sellers have to issue a receipt on every sale. if the machine is down or there is a power interruption they can use a manual receipt and inform the relevant tax office.
experts at the ethiopian revenue and customs authority (erca) said that they have not heard about the paper shortage affecting business.
ephrem mekonnen, public relations head of erca, told capital that the business community is trying to connect the issue to the hard currency shortage.
“it is known that the hard currency shortage affects the economic activity, but it is an exaggeration to say the market is being slowed down by a of machine paper,” he added.
besides the imports   local producers are also engaged in the production, while the hard currency shortage may affect the usual supply, he says.
there are importers of the paper, but it is also produced locally by haron computer plc.
kedir hashim, chief operation head at haron, told capital that his paper factory is also affected by the shortage of raw material which is imported.
“we have tried our best to supply the paper for clients directly as opposed to providing it to distributers,” kedir said. “we are providing the paper to distributors at the micro level but our priority is direct users to harmonize the market and maintain a reasonable price,” he added.
haron is also one of the major cash register machine suppliers authorized by erca. the company stated that its paper distribution covers wide areas in oromia and snnp regions in addition to the capital.
according to kedir, the association of machine and software suppliers has tried to work with the authority closely to solve the challenge. he said that erca is helping suppliers to get the hard currency from banks, while public banks are not giving priority to them like private banks are. “if we have a  support letter from erca the private banks are relatively collaborative, which is not the case at public banks,” he said.
he advised that the government should give prior attention for the sector since it is directly related with the government revenue.
as of the first nine months of the past budget year that ended a week ago 172,088 businesses use 188,416 cash register machines throughout the country. every year the number of users is increasing significantly. for instance, for the first nine months of the stated budget year 9,295 new users were included on the system. thirteen companies are actively engaged in supplying the machine."
"police are looking into a transaction made between the ethiopian industrial input development enterprise (eiide) and end global food processing p.l.c. after it received a tip about low quality delivery from a production manager at the latter’s factory.
police opened the investigation the day after receiving information. they then searched the warehouse where the soap was stored. police took 40 packet samples from the store and banned the rest which is over 24,000 packs.
last thursday police reviewed the situation with the ethiopian conformity assessment enterprise (ecae) and opened the warehouse after receiving results from ecae but still banned the soap from being distributed.
the soap failed to meet grade one standards and the results are being used as evidence for the investigation process, a source close to the case told capital.
end global signed an agreement to deliver grade one quality soap to eiide after winning the competitive bid at the end of september 2017.
the procurement attracted four detergent production companies. only three returned the bid document. among the three eiide has chosen two companies to supply the detergent where toria soap and detergent industries failed to supply reasoning the devaluation of birr to be a barrier.
the enterprise confiscated its 100,000 birr security bond from toria, and proceeds deals with end global which was willing to meet its commitment.
end global promised to deliver the soap within six months starting october 2017, which was later extended to eight months, but they delivered only 17% by may 2018.
the company, established with an investment license nine years to process food, changed its investment to detergent production. unfortunately it was not able to change its name because of the delay in the government procedure, according to liyu yemeshaw, the ceo of the company.
mesgena welday, owner of end global, argues that it is not the first time the soap has failed the quality tests rather it’s its second time. he said the failure in the agreed quality is normal and falling the grade one requirements didn’t mean that its harmful, rather it’s in the permitted range of grade two in the nation.
he said that when the ecae said it didn’t meet the first grade the soaps were sold in merkato and replaced with the grade one. “the failure and replacement procedure is normal not only for our delivery but we also saw other companies which were taking out goods which didn’t meet the standards,” he said.
inderis negus, the acting ceo of the eiide shares mesgna’s idea that returning the products which don’t fit the requirement is normal. “we return many other items not only soap when they fail the requirement,” he told capital.
he also explains that after the goods are delivered to the warehouse we will wait for the ecae result to accept the delivery. “whenever there is a defect in quality we will return the goods back,” inderis said.
he admits that the company is suffering from the returning defecting products as it consumes extra time but it is our commitment to our customers.
inderis also argues that the eiide goes further to meet the standard expectation of the consumers even beyond what other government organizations want. “this is the main reason why we are suffering from the returning back of goods,” he adds.
the eiide emerged after absorbing merchandise wholesale import & trade enterprise (mwite) two years ago. the mwite was formed in 1993 with the merger of the ethiopian domestic distribution corporation (eddc) and ethiopian import export corporation (eiec) following the change in the regime and economic reform."
"the addis ababa water and sewerage authority (aawsa) says they have enough water to meet the needs of city residents but are struggling to distribute it.
while inaugurating a waste treatment plant at kality on saturday july 7 the head of aawsa, awoke hailemariam blamed the hard currency shortage for the problem.
during a lengthy speech, he criticized banks for prioritizing hard currency distribution over other commodities when water is vital for everyone.
awoke said that because there isn’t enough hard currency, several well drilling projects have been delayed since they require electromechanical parts. he wants the federal government to step in and help alleviate the problem.
in the past five years the authority has spent over ten billion birr secured from the government’s coffer and foreign loans to tap more water for the city. rehabilitating dams and drilling new wells during the last five years has enabled the city’s water supply to increase to 92 percent from about 53 in 2013.
more needs to be done as demand continues to increase. the population of addis is growing very rapidly and a large amount of infrastructure is being built, add that to the fact that some wells have not been dug and all this means that the current water coverage has dramatically declined from 92 percent in 2016 to 65 percent currently.  so even though water production has increased the distribution and coverage has actually declined.
the production capacity of aawsa has reached 618,000 m3 per day; meanwhile the demand stands at 866,540 m3 per day. awoke said that the actual production capacity is 525,000m3 if there is not any interruption like power cuts on the distribution process.
old pipeline networks, waste, lack of technology, power interruption, damage to pipeline networks, lack of adequate financing and low tariffs that do not cover the operation costs are challenges hindering the authority from getting enough water to its citizens.
the aawsa head seriously criticized negligence, corruption and theft at the agency although he says these things have been reduced.
the kality waste water treatment became a reality through financing by the world bank and the cost was covered by the government and world bank. it can treat 100,000 m3 of water per day. usd 100 million came from the world bank and 759 million birr from the government."
"the basic labour union of the ethiopian industrial input development enterprise (eiide) has filed a claim to the ministry of industry (moi) about the challenges that the enterprise faces.
in the 15 page letter employees address what they feel are strengths and challenges of eiide.
the letter was sent to  moi on monday july 9 and copied to nine public offices including the office of the prime minister, ministry of finance and economic cooperation, ministry of trade and the eiide board. in it 14 problems were addressed.  the enterprise was expected to feed the industrial sector by supplying inputs and encouraging the producers to distribute  manufactured products with widespread distribution centers across the country.
however they stated that several problems like misconduct and  lack of proper management have caused  the body to be endangered.
according to the letter that capital obtained, the management and the former board have not managed the organization well.
the enterprise is renting an office around vatican embassy for around 13 million birr a year. that price rises one million birr every year.
mohammed awel, chairman of the trade union.
says the enterprise uses the building located in piazza as its head office.
eiide was formed about four years ago by taking most of the operation of merchandise wholesale and import trade enterprise (mewit), which was established in 1993 through a merger between trading groups, including the ethiopian domestic distribution corporation and the ethiopian import export corporation.
the letter claimed when mewit was formed the office of the import export corporation was not transferred to mewit and it should be returned and an  additional office made for eiide rather than paying a huge amount for rent.
they also said that there have unlawful sales and procurement of rebar.
the letter indicated some managers overseeing millions of birr have fled abroad or abruptly quit.
the 3,000 employee enterprise handles 14 billion birr in materials. they letter is asking for the governments help to properly manage the agency.
recently capital reported that about three months ago the founding ceo of eiide, asfawossen alene fled to the us with his deputy, the ceo for procurement, abay kebede.
employees said there has been corruption at the agency related to rebar fraud.
in his email abay sent to capital from the us he argued that he did not flee to the us but instead is on annual leave for medical reasons. however the human resource division   reported that  abiy is absent from his duty without getting approval for  annual leave.
eiide recently hired a new board chairperson and other new blood in the board of directors including melakualebel, the recently appointed minister of trade, who was assigned to chair the board, and ahmed tussa, the recently assigned state minister of finance and economic cooperation.
the former board was chaired by mebrahtu melese (phd), who is now state minister of trade.
capital’s effort to talk bogalefeleke, state minister for the ministry of industry, who is responsible to look after the enterprise, was unfruitful."
"cbe has been installing improved atm, automated teller machines software since last sunday which means faster transaction service.
the bank started the customer data migration and updating of the machines, according to belihu takele, communications manager of the bank. the procedure took a week to finish updating the 800 atms out of the 1,700 machines in existence took a bit longer than expected due to technical failures.
the new software is loaded on the bank’s servers to manage the card related services.
customers whom capital talked with expressed frustration over the service interruption during the transition.  belihu said that the bank would have warned its customers if it knew the delay would happen.
“the change in the switch was being done with a project which will enable improved and additional services,” belihu told capital.
long rows, both at the atm stations and cashiers windows, were observed and customers were forced to spend hours waiting to withdraw cash.
the bank which currently holds 4 million cardholders conducts 400,000 transactions through its automated machines in ethiopia according to belihu. the bank has more than 16 million depositors in 1,240 branches withholding 510 billion birr worth of assets.
the 75 year old bank loans 437 billion birr and currently has 50 thousand staff."
"the airspace between ethiopia and eritrea that has been closed by a notice to airmen (notam) of the ethiopian civil aviation authority to the international civil aviation organization (icao) has opened as of thursday.
sources at the authority told capital that the airspace has been opened as of thursday two days before the eritrean president travels to ethiopia for an official visit.
in relation to his visit last sunday to asmara abiy ahmed (phd), prime minister, has agreed with eritrean head of state president isayas afeworqi to re-commence road and air transport in addition to using sea ports in eretria.
the visit of the two leaders has occurred after two decades since the outbreak of the border war and ’cold war’ peace condition.
early this week ethiopia airlines (et) announced that it would begin daily flights  to asmara as of july 17, which would be the first time since it stopped in may 1998. its first flight would be with the most technologically advanced commercial aircraft, the boeing 787, according to the statement ethiopian sent to capital.
the two countries agreed in 1993 to undertake commercial flights that will allow ethiopian to fly without further negotiations.
according to reports, the pm’s flight route went via djibouti to get to eritrea.  since the eritrean air space is opened the flights to the north will be shorter and more fuel efficient. for its flights to the middle east and other countries in the north, et has been forced to use the airspace of djibouti and sudan, which is more costly in terms of time and fuel.
other airlines that use this area has also been affected by the notam in relation to the civil aviation authority notam which announced the opening of the airspace to eritrea, other airlines will also use this space."
"coffee export earnings, which is ethiopia’s major source of foreign currency, declined during this past fiscal year even though the volume of coffee exports rose.
during the 2017/18 budget year, which ended july 7, usd 838.2 million came from coffee exports. a year ago the brought in usd 882 million. that is a reduction of usd 44 million.
in the 2017/18 budget year 238,465 metric tons were exported throughout the world. in 2016/17 225,668 metric tons of the green bean were exported, according to the latest report from the coffee and tea development and marketing authority.
coffee revenue is far from what was hoped for in the gtp ii matrix.
according to the authority’s report, the achievement for the year was 88.2 percent in volume and 72.4 percent in value.
germany has continued to be the major destination for ethiopian coffee with 22 percent share of the total export volume. according the report the coffee and tea authority revealed, germany has imported 51,634 metric tons with usd 145 million revenue, which is 17 percent of the total revenue.
usa and saudi arabia stood in  the second and third position. the us has bought usd 141 million worth or 26,656 metric tons, while saudi imported 37,405 metric tons of coffee with usd 121 million.  japan, belgium, south korea, italy, sudan, france, and uk are in third to tenth place respectively.
from the total export these ten importers covered 86.2 percent and 84.4 percent of the volume and the value respectively."
"the addis ababa cultural and tourism bureau (aactb) wants to have its own office. however the agency reports that because of slow g+12 head office construction work being done by the metals and engineering corporation (metec), the bureau has wasted nine million birr on house rent.
currently the bureau is paying 538,000 birr a month to rent an office around arat killo. since 2014 they have paid 25 million birr in rent. when the building is finished it will be the office for actb, the addis ababa children and youth sport center, a theater and a game emporium. six years ago metec agreed to complete the project at a cost of 348.3 million birr in three years time. however, the corporation requested an additional 200 million birr from the addis ababa city administration construction and housing development bureau (achdb) to complete the project.
the hard currency shortage and the increasing cost of finishing materials are the reasons given by metec for the total increasing cost of the construction.
achdb is not happy with metec’s request. they wrote a letter to the cultural and tourism bureau to administer the project but the bureau told the construction bureau to finish the project. a letter is signed by tesfaye omega, vice head of actb said the misunderstanding between the construction bureau and the consultant is costing time and money.
“by no means transferring the administration to cultural bureau is not a fair thing. the construction bureau has not had good coordination with the consultants. when the consultants ask for a price adjustment achdb, which made the deal in the first place,  has the duty to entertain  the question but instead it is trying to escape the challenge by transferring the problem to us which is not legal.”
habtamu tekle, the addis ababa children and youth center ceo told capital that poor supervision by achdb is the big reason behind the delay of the project.
“metec asked for a price adjustment to achdb one year ago but they replied recently and told the cultural bureau to administer the project. it is misunderstanding by stakeholders that is   retarding the project.”
he added that the building work needs a   fast response from the administration  so the building can be finished and used for its indented purpose.
addis ababa children and youth center is currently using an old hall located in  arat klilo."
"after receiving repeated complaints from people living near the national tobacco enterprise  the addis ababa environmental protection authority (aaepa) closed the enterprise located in sarbet because the smoke and odor being emitted by the company is harmful to people living around there.
the enterprise was ordered to plant treatment machines to restart the operation.
dwellers in the area said the company discharges its waste in a normal drainage system and they suspect that the pollution has created problems with their respiratory system.
after closing the enterprise last friday aaepa officials told capital that dust and waste coming through the company threatens human lives.
“we have warned them many times but they are not willing to do what we ordered and finally we were obliged to close it till the matter is solved with the right treatment plant.’’
the enterprise which lies on 20,000 square meters has also faced criticism for poor safety management and treatment of employees.
capital’s effort to get an opinion from the enterprise was not fruitful.
recently forty percent of the enterprise was sold to japanese tobacco giant, japan tobacco international.
japan tobacco international (jti) won the open international bid for the partial acquisition of the national tobacco enterprise sc.
a year ago jti acquired 40 percent of nte with a record sale of usd 510 million. the deal was the second largest in the history of the country.
currently jti spends close to usd one billion on ethiopia’s tobacco industry in just one year, through the privatization of nte. they now own 70.95 percent share.
currently, jti has a presence in seven african countries, including sudan, south africa and nigeria.
the number of smokers in ethiopia is higher than most african countries due to its population size. more than 100,000 children and 2.3 million adults smoke cigarettes each day in ethiopia, according the tobacco atlas – a compendium of research on tobacco use by the american cancer society and the world lung foundation. over the past five years, the annual turnover of the nte has continually increased by an average of 190 million br. it offers five brands: nyala, gissila, elleni, delight and nyala premium. the company currently employs close to 1,000 workers."
"it is a shocking surprise but the us dollar has actually gone down on the black market over the past week, capital learned.
people who closely follow the parallel market, have noticed the trend and some experts think it may be a precursor of significant change.
according to capital’s observation the market has been saturating with dollars every day this week. for instance a week ago the rate stood at 37 birr per usd, while the legal market or bank exchange rate is 27.27 birr to one usd.
the difference between the parallel market and the legal one had been over 36 percent, a record high on the exchange market.
people who trade on the black market that capital interviewed said that they could not understand the reason for the sharp drop in the exchange rate over the past seven days. right now they are not interested in buying the dollar or other main hard currencies because they can’t currently speculate about the market’s trend.
according to the information that capital obtained from parallel market traders, who refused to be named, they are afraid that hard currency they bought will devalue.
now there is actually a larger supply of dollars on the black market than demand, they added.
according to the traders the rate of a usd went down to 32 birr on friday july 6, from 34.50 birr a day before and to 28 birr on saturday. “we have observed significant decrease every day,” one of the illegal hard currency buyers told capital. “we don’t know the reason this happened,” he added.
according to the market actors on friday june 29 the rate was 37 birr for a usd. that rate began to drop last saturday.
the hard currency shortage, the stagnation of export earnings and illegal market or contraband had been the main reason for the rising black market rate besides for those who use it for illicit means or collect hard currency in relation to past political instability in the country.
observers stated that some the fdis’ were also involved in collecting foreign currency from the parallel market, which caused the black market rate to skyrocket.
before the government devaluated the birr by 15 percent in october 11, 2017 the black market was stood around 27 birr for a usd, while immediately after the devaluation it escalated to 33 birr. for a long time it was about 25 percent higher than the legal market. however in the past few months the parallel market frequently increased and the gap with the bank rate widened up to 36 percent.
experts who closely followed the sector commented that the black market reduction in the past week is a result of relative stability in the country and more hard currency has come into the country since the new pm took office.
“even though there are several reasons for the reduction of the rate of the parallel market, the government has been working to control illegal business or contraband and illegal hard currency flow via border areas at the eastern, southern and western parts of the country,” experts explained.
“the government’s empowerment to control contraband has forced illegal actors to reduce trading foreign currency from the black market,” experts explained.
regions like oromia are also working strongly to control the contraband goods entering the county illegally.
this trade has been one of the sources of conflict along the somali and oromia regions. the former pm hailemariam desalegn stated that the conflict and the displacement of ethiopians from the somali region by the regional special force (leyu hayl) are directly related with the contraband business that the oromia tried to control."
"shareholders of one of the city’s prominent hospitals, saint yared, are going through a dispute.
the private health facility formed about 13 years ago went from being a clinic to a high level hospital when it was initially formed by two shareholders.
then a few years ago a third shareholder joined the ownership.
now 56 percent of the hospital is owned by akeze teame (md), 36 percent is owned by sisay shimeles and 10 percent by getahun yitbarek (md).
sisay, one of the two founding shareholders, told capital that initially the facility was run without any disagreement. he said that mistrust occurred when the major shareholder established another health centre separately. there was a conflict of interest because the other facility took business from yared.
he claimed that the hospital operation has been dominated by relatives of the major shareholder. “the major disagreement erupted when we asked the company to be audited because we were concerned after we did not receive a dividend disbursement.”
then the two shareholders insisted on undertaking an auditing, but the major shareholder rejected the idea.
“when i insisted on auditing and sending the report to the ethiopian revenue and customs authority (erca) the management of the hospital reported to erca, which conducted an audit for a limited period,” he said.
“the finding of erca indicated that the facility did not settle about 12 million birr in taxes during the auditing period, but since the company willingly reported the case to erca the amount was reduced to 8 million birr and we are paying that now,” sisay said.
according to the shareholders the audit of erca did not cover the entire period since the hospital was formed in 2008.  it covered from 2012 so we want to see the audit report for the previous period, because we suspect that there was mismanagement during that time.
when he rejected being audited, dr getahun, the minor shareholder that joined the group in 2015, filed the case to the court. he claimed he should not have to pay the accrued tax because he was not part of the shareholders. instead he argues that the auditing should go back to the time the hospital was established.
“when we tried to solve our problem amicably, dr akeze insisted we buy his share without audit or valuation,” the shareholder said.
they claimed that they have already filed their criminal and civil claims to police this week.
a few weeks ago capital reported that employees of st yared were worried that they could lose their livelihoods due to an enduring disagreement between the hospital’s shareholders.
according to employees capital spoke with, the hospital is considered by many to be one of the best health facilities in town but morale among staff has been low since shareholders have been unable to reach a common consensus over a dispute between management and the financial administration.
capital has attempted to get a comment from the major shareholder, dr akeze, but he refused to respond to repeated phone calls. he did respond to a text saying that the dispute between the three partners is being handled by lawyers and the courts."
"the gambela health bureau states that the hiv prevalence rate has risen from 0.8 percent to 4.8 percent, or nearly 5 out of 100 people.
the gambela region, has seen its 480,000 population nearly double from an influx of 380,000 south sudanese refugees.
according to a source in the bureau some south sudanese refugees are being forced into prostitution further contributing to the problem.
many clans practice non-monogamy and seldom use condoms which places people in a high risk category for contracting the disease. the highest rate of hiv is among the mezenger people although the rate has been increasing in the anuak and nuer tribe as well. women are being infected more often than men.
“the health bureau staff have been working hard but we have had difficulty achieving tangible results because people are reluctant to change their behavior. among some ethic groups husbands encourage visitors to have sex with their wives or for their children to have unprotected sex with multiple partners.”
adolescents between 13 and 18, in the region often contract hiv/aids and seem unaware of the risks involved with unprotected sex, according to the source who added that politicians and elders in the region should do more to increase awareness and encourage behavioral change.
“unless the elders in the region see this as a problem we will not be able to make a dent in the hiv rate,” the source said.
around 90 percent of the people in gambela are subsistence farmers who sell some produce in local markets. others cultivate coffee or explore for gold as in dimma wereda. in alwero-peno wereda there are state owned farms which mainly grow cotton.  there are also malaysian and chinese companies exploring for oil. the anuak grow crops, hunt and fish and the nuer raise livestock. pressure on the land has increased as the population has doubled in the last 25 years and some has been sold to foreign investors such as those from saudi arabia who use the land for rice farms."
"the national planning commission (npc) announced that ethiopian’s per capita income reached usd 863 in 2016/17 and the country’s gdp now stands at 1.8 trillion birr.
the commission that appeared at the parliament to deliver a report of on an 11 month performance of the fiscal year which ended yesterday stated the country’s supply side gdp grew by 10.9 percent during the 2016/17 budget year.
the npc report stated the agriculture sector grew 6.7 percent, which was around two percent in the 2015/16 budget year. the industry and service sector grew 18.7 percent and 10.3 percent respectively.
“in the time market rate the expenditure side gdp stood at 1.807 trillion birr, which is usd 66.2 billion with the current exchange rate,” the report explained.
for the 2015/16 budget year the gdp stood at 1.5 trillion birr, with is a growth of 17.2 percent, the commission report says.
per capita income has also risen. it stated that a year ago per capita income stood at usd 863 meaning it has grown by  62usd  compared with the preceding year.
in the 2015/16 budget year the per capita income was usd 801.
the report stated that the service sector continues have the biggest share of gdp at 39.3 percent. the report indicated the service sector grew by 0.2 percent. while the agriculture sector, which was affected by el niño made up 36.3 percent. agriculture went down from 37.8 percent to 36.3 percent of the gdp.
according to the report industrial sector, which was mainly dominated by construction sector, has grown more than service, at 1.3 percent compared to the 2015/16 budget year.
the report stated that the gdp share of the industrial sector is 24.4 percent.
government officials argued that in the past decade the country registered double digit growth but some international financial and economic organizations and local economic experts say the growth is not that high. however all agree that ethiopia has been growing economically at a very high rate.  at his appearance at the parliament pm abiy ahmed (phd) hinted that the country’s economic growth for the past budget year would be between nine and 10 percent."
"during a recent panel discussion organized by the addis ababa chamber of commerce and sectoral association (aaccsa) at hilton hotel economic experts said unless significant reform takes place, including restructuring the national bank of ethiopia (nbe), ethiopia’s economic growth and progress will be hindered and a recession may occur.
alemayehu geda (prof), kebour ghenna, eyob tesfaye (phd), and seid nuru (phd) expressed concerns about the country’s economic situation and the process being implemented to privatize state owned enterprises. meanwhile, economists, alemayehu and seid questioned the validity of economic statistics the government has used to claim ethiopia’s economy has been consistently growing by double digits.
during their presentation the two economists argued that there is little empirical evidence to suggest the country did in fact register double digit economic growth. for example the government claims that poverty has declined, but they pointed to data indicating that 60% to 70% of the ethiopian population is currently living below the poverty line. this differs from the government’s data which says only 22 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2016.
the panelists expressed fears that growth would stagnate followed by a recession if reforms did not take place soon.
“first a common consensus [about economic policy] between the government and public has to be reached,” seid nuru (phd), from the ethiopian economists association, said.
eyob tesfaye (phd), a former senior economic official and expert in international organization, said the (nbe) should be reformed.
“policies have to be changed and the finance sector needs comprehensive restructuring,” he added.
he added that a person with experience in commercial banking must be hired at the central bank (nbe). “the duty of the central bank is different from business,” he argued.
others who spoke at the event said the developmental economy has not done enough to boost exports, which have declined to 4.4 percent of the gdp from 5.5 percent in the past.
the developmental economy has been exclusive, unequal and featured unemployment.
another concern, in addition to declining exports is a widening balance of payment gap; (the overall record of all economic transactions of a country compared with the rest of the world).
unemployment also remains high in the country. the government estimates a rate of 25 percent but alehayemu says that figure is much higher especially when underemployment is taken into account.
“no country has grown without the private sector playing an active role,” eyob said. he went on to say that we need to work together to create a private sector that can change the country.
kebour countered, however that the government needs to play a significant role in transforming the economy. he said youth need to come together and sacrifice to build the state as occurred in china.  privatization of public enterprises is not advantageous for the country, he argued.
eyob recommended that the government float shares internationally, while at the same time having the public be the complete owners of the enterprise. this has been done successfully in other countries with large companies.
the panel also wants a stronger focus on professionalism in all sectors. this would greatly improve economic performance, they said.
finally they were unhappy about the recent 15 percent devaluation of the birr. the government did this partially to improve export earnings but they argued that without a surplus and competitive output there is no positive effect of the devaluation other than increasing the price of import items, which contributes to inflation."
"the rate of law students who failed their exit exams trended upward this year.
capital spoke with representatives at several universities including the university of gondar (uog) which has 85 candidates. they had six students fail which is five higher than the past year.
jigjiga had a whopping 58% of their students fail and sodo had 25% failure. four percent failed at hawassa, and 3.3% at mekele. areas where there is unrest appear to have the highest failure rates.
the regular student’s failure ratio reached 3% last year with an increase of the cumulative mark achieved, according to seid b mohamed who is a researcher at the higher education strategic center (hesc).  also, 74% non-regular students failed which has been a concerning issue for the government.
there were a record number of candidates this year, 4,005 students registered to take the exam and 37 lecturers participated in the evaluation.
the exam was given at the beginning of may which is a month later than normal.
“we prepared our students to take the exam at the normal time but the ministry of education (moe) convinced us to extend it,” said abebe assefa, dean of school of law at uog and the chairman of the national law schools consortium (mlsc).
students capital talked with agreed with abebe.
“we went to the externship program prior to taking the exam, but previously every law student would start preparing after the end of their fourth year until they take the exam then they will go out for an externship,” said a student.
also, another student said that the change of schedule also frustrated him. “we missed different classes whenever there are protests and that is not only for the last year but also for the previous three years”.
tadesse tilaye and gemede banata were at the compound of national education assessment and examinations agency (neaea) to seek if there is any way to re-evaluate their exam.
tadesse rationalized that the current year’s exam was taken with a month delay and he believes that teachers evaluated the exam in a rush.
“there is no law which allows the re-evaluation, and we are just an executive of different manuals issued by mlsc,” said yosef abera, director at the agency.
but abebe said there is no law which prohibits re-evaluation. “the manuals are silent”.
according to the manual issued by the consortium, which is a forum of every school of law deans, last year students which failed to get a passing mark will be able to take the test an unlimited number of times. previously they were allowed to take it five times.
seid argues that someone who spends five years in the university must not be sent out of the system because he failed to get a pass mark five times. he said the exam aimed to raise the competence of the students but not to boot out any candidate from the system.
“the decision is made by the deans, which represents the school,” abebe said in agreement with seid.
the hesc conducted research on the performance of the exam and concluded that it is meeting its plans. the research also reveals 76% of students who took the exam believe it is necessary.
the exam, which has been given for the past seven years, has four categories: private, public, procedural and miscellaneous, they review most of the material the students learn during their enrollment."
"a blaze that destroyed shops on thursday at 1:30 am damaged 57 million birr in property and 140 shops near grand anwar mosque in mercato .
the cause of the fire, which took four hours and 147 fire fighters to control, is still under investigation.
the addis ababa city fire and emergency prevention and rescue agency used 18 fire trucks and 548,500 liters of water and 900 liters of foam for the rescue operation and managed to save 65 million birr.
three ambulances were also available for emergency services but no person died nor injured in the fire.
electronic devices like mobile phones, tapes, televisions, clothes and food like butter, and honey were in the shops.
solomon mekonen, communication director of the agency told capital that the cause is still unknown but rumors were spreading after the incident.
“our job to is to save human life and property, the police investigate the cause.” according to solomon the sheet iron which the shops were made of helped the fire to spread.
eye witness who were near in the incident said many people were looting and stealing from the shops."
"a man who was caught carrying a significant amount of foreign currency out of the country was granted bail.
mekonen abreham, who allegedly attempted to carry 36,000 usd; 14,000 etb and 4,500 euro to djibouti without a permit when he was stopped during a routine check via the x-ray at the bole international airport. the police report stated mekonen had the cash, which amounts to approximately 1.14 million birr, in his bag.
mekonen claimed he was taking the money to pay his drivers in djibouti.
prosecutors argued mekonen could be a flight risk especially since he has permanent residence in djibouti. they wanted him to be prevented from leaving the country. however the court disagreed and allowed him to be released on two million birr bail.
prosecutors of the office sighted the national bank of ethiopia’s establishment proclamation as violated. the proclamation made forbids any foreign currency to be carried without a permit and also ethiopian birr exceeding the minimum limit set by the bank.
the suspect was released and ordered to appear on july 12, 2018. at that hearing he will enter a plea.
the money was confiscated and receipts are being used as evidence.
foreign currency and khat are frequently confiscated by customs officials at bole international airport."
"tsemex hotels and business plc (thb), which is having trouble accessing the disbursement of overseas loans, has asked for the involvement of the federal government and pm abiy ahmed (phd).
in the letter the company sent to the pm early this week it expressed its concern about the effect the delay would have on their hotel.
the company formed as a subsidiary of tsemex global enterprise to become a player in the growing chain hotel industry has had its potential five star hotel delayed, even though it secured extraordinary finance from the international finance corporation (ifc), the world bank’s private financial wing, to undertake the project.
according to the letter that the company sent to abiy, it asked for the support of the federal government for the approval of an external plot of land around the hotel project at lideta area.
in its initial agreement in 2012 with intercontinental hotel group (ihg) it stated that tbh would have a parking lot capable of holding 200 cars to be managed under the brand of crowne plaza. however, the ifc has signed a deal of close to a usd 20 million loan for the development of the hotel which would be considered a hard currency generator.
according to rezene ayalew, managing director of tbh, the first portion of the usd 18.86 million loan was disbursed after  the office of the mayor of city government of addis ababa gave a confirmation letter in 2015 for the allocation of the requested 1,000 meter square plot.
however because the legal dispute over the name of crown and crowne forced tbh to select another manager,  the french based international hotel manager accorhotels group to manage a brand of the mgallery by sofitel, the plot was never awarded to the company.
“meanwhile the city administration has tried to support us but we could not secure the requested land,” he told capital.
he says due to the delay of accessing the land which is set as a precondition of the second phase of loan disbursement the entire project has been delayed. “we are now forced to pay an interest of 5.38 percent for the disbursed loan and 2 percent commission for the balance unreleased,” the letter that the thb sent to the pm on monday june 18 reads.
“the delay has also escalated the cost of the project from usd 37 million to usd 46.5 million,” rezene said.
“it was the responsibility of the government to push such kind of projects to include ample parking as observed in other countries, but the opposite occurs in our country,” the managing director complained.
“we are now frustrated waiting for the final decision from the government,” he said. the company head said that about three months ago we have been submitted a similar letter to the former pm.
when ifc approved the loan it has considered the capacity of the hotel that could gross over usd 14 million per annum. the hotel, which has 221 rooms, is expected to be opened within 12 months for service, if the balance of the loan is released."
"it has now been three months since the disappearance of the ceo at the ethiopian industrial input development enterprise (eiide), asfawossen alene and his deputy abay kebede.
sources at eiide claimed that the two were involved in unethical and illegal activities and that was their motive for going to the us, where their family is based.
according to sources, the ceo has not been seen at his office since march 14. “initial reports were that he was on annual leave but as of now he has not returned,” sources said. despite his absence the company has paid his salary for three months and his mobile phone bill.
capital has confirmed that currently idirs niguss, the other deputy ceo has been assigned as acting director.
eiide replaced the former merchandise wholesale and import trade enterprise (mewit), when it split into two. the organization is one of the biggest public enterprises with a huge sum of procurements from local and overseas markets.
sources claim that in fact eiide was established to support industrialization by supplying industrial inputs that did not meet their target and were mainly engaged in the operation that mewit had undertaken in the past.
“about 80 percent of our sales are finished products,” sources said.
idirs niguss, who represents the ceo when he leaves the office, confirmed that the ceo left the office three months ago. he argued that asfawossen had left the office due to family issues.
idirs added that asfawossen has submitted his resignation from the us. the other deputy ceo for procurement, abay has also announced that he resigned from his post due to a health issue.
sources said that abay has not been seen since monday june 18, when he parked the automobile he used at the office compound located at the vatican embassy.
idirs confirmed that the deputy also submitted his resignation a few days after his disappearance.
sources said that the deputy ceo also traveled to the us. according to sources, there is a police investigation ongoing at the enterprise in relation with the procurement of rebar.
however they claimed that there are several scandals at the enterprise including the head office rent when it has its own facility at piazza.
idirs argued that the enterprise is trying its best to supply inputs like cotton and leather for the manufacturing industries. however he said that the economic situation in the past couple of years has influenced the activity of the enterprise. he has also confirmed that there is an investigation being carried out by police.
asfawossen served as head of the large taxpayers branch office of the ethiopian revenues and customs authority before he came to eiide as the first ceo. abay, had been working at mewit for a long period.
employees at the enterprise insisted that the government has to give adequate attention at the enterprise since there are many illegal activities occurring there. they claimed that there are organized and networked corruption acts going on from top to bottom employees of the organization.
early last week the new federal government reshuffled the board of the enterprise. according to idris, melaku alebel, the recently appointed minister of trade, was assigned to chair the board, while ahmed tussa, the recently assigned state minister of finance and economic cooperation who served on several top positions in the past, was appointed as vice chair of the board.
the former board was chaired by mebrahtu melese (phd), who is now state minister of trade."
"india, which imports 30 percent of ethiopia’s pulse products may halt imports because ethiopia has not fumigated the pulses.
india gave six months for ethiopia to fumigate its pulses, a deadline which expired yesterday saturday june 30, and india has stated they will not import any more pulse products until the matter is dealt with.
ethiopia stands to lose up to usd 80 million a year if india stops importing pulses. fumigation is a method of pest control that completely fills an area with gaseous pesticides to suffocate or poison the pests. it is used to control pests in  soil, grain, and produce, and is also used during processing of goods to be imported or exported to prevent transfer of exotic organisms.
india said it doesn’t want to spend additional money on chemicals and human labor to fumigate the pulses.  white and red beans, chick peas, horn beans, green mung beans and soya beans are the major pulse products india imports from ethiopia.
the ministry of trade who had a meeting with pulse and oilseeds exporters last thursday at capital hotel warned the ministry of agriculture and natural resources to start the fumigation process very soon.
in the last eleven months ethiopia exported 402,000 tons of pulses and earned usd 402 million, they had plans to export 568,704 tons and earn usd 423 million.
india imported about 6 million tons of pulses last year from different countries.
in other news 8,730 tons of sesame were exported illegally over the last eleven years which caused the country to lose over two billion birr. the ministry of trade also announced that it has received over 63,403 tons of sesame in stores where the exporters, suppliers and producers had horded the product to get a better price in the future. it stated also that some exporters sold the product below the international market price to get dollars quickly.
melaku alebel, minister of trade said exporters should work harder to bring more quality products to the market.
“the reason we are failing to fill the gap of hard currency demand is our weak performance in export and if we do not export more we cannot get dollars which ultimately causes trouble for out investments.’’
however, exporters said the government should make it easier to get loans."
"cite questionable financial activities, salaries  for ‘ghost’ workersemployees of saint yared hospital worry they may lose their livelihoods due to an enduring disagreement between the hospital’s shareholders.
according to employees capital spoke with, the hospital is considered by many to be one of the best health facilities in town but morale among staff has been low since shareholders have been unable to reach a common consensus over a dispute between management and the financial administration.
staff claim that the company administration mainly those responsible for overseeing   financial issues are close relatives of the major shareholder and this has created a falling-out with the other share owners.
some of the management, they said, including the operation manager, finance director, auditor and other prominent positions are held by close relatives of the major shareholder.
this has led to serious problems such as recently when the ethiopian revenue and customs authority (erca) billed the hospital for a large amount of uncollected tax, the employees capital interviewed pointed out.
some of the financial officers are said to have quit their jobs at the hospital in response to the murky financial structure. a letter that one of the finance officers wrote in his exit report that capital obtained, indicated that there are several reasons for this. they include:  lack of proper management of financial documents and financial statements, and issuing cash invoices and cash receipts without a sufficient reason. the employee stated this was why he resigned. the former finance officer said that the hospital’s leadership is knotted by family.
the employees also claim that there are individuals who are included on the payroll and are being paid large salaries, but who do not exist in the company and haven’t been seen on duty. “if they are shareholders they have to earn the revenue from their dividends,” the employees argued.
the workers said that there is a disagreement between the two groups of managers; one of them represents the majority of shareholders and their dispute has affected the activity of the hospital.
the hospital’s worker association asked for clarification from the shareholders about the operation and ongoing condition of the company. the association stated in the beginning of the letter that the hospital had a good reputation in the past but this last year the hospital’s performance has declined which is causing employees to worry. the association also asked why the company has been unable to pay the income tax that was collected from employees to the relevant authority on time and requested clarification regarding who is responsible for paying the accrued tax. the letter also addressed several other concerns.
“the company is under nepotism and this affects the employees, the shareholders and the country,” one of the employees told capital.
he said that the company was not audited for the past several years which has motivated the association to notify relevant government offices. one employee said: “the dominance of one individual is affecting the entire hospital and we are afraid the company might dissolve the employees’ legal rights.”
the employees via their association voiced their concern to the labour and social affairs bureau of the bole sub city and the confederation of ethiopian labour unions.
“we have also submitted a complaint to the federal ethics and anticorruption commission about the unethical activities, illegal financial flow, and other questionable activities in the company including urging that an audit be conducted,” a representative said. they have also reported the issue to the federal police to investigate the illegal acts.
“we need government intervention for a solution at the company that employs over 200 people for the benefit of the serenity of the industry, the patients and employees,” they said. “this big facility is now deteriorating because of the disagreement between the shareholders,” they added.
sisay abebe, co-manager of st. yared hospital, who is also a founding member and shareholder at the hospital, told capital that he has been informed about the employee’s concern. he accepted the association’s claim which was that there was not an agreement among the management.  “it is the livelihood of the employees who have been working for several years. i agree with them,”
the hospital is administered by two managers who have co-signed. “one of the co-managers is affiliated with the major shareholder,” he said.
hiwot tirfneh, co-manager of st. yared hospital, on her part told capital that there is a disagreement between the shareholders that is being handled by the court. she declined to comment about the disagreement since the case is at the court, but she said that she has information about the concern of the employees. she added that so far the hospital is conducting services and their wages are being regularly paid.
the employees however, expressed their concern that while the shareholders are under a dispute the hospital’s lease contract could be terminated as early as july according to a notification from the lessor.  this has escalated their concern and feeling of insecurity.
according to the information capital obtained yared hospital was formed more than a decade ago by two individuals namely akeze teame (md), sisay shimeles and lately getahun yitbarek (md) has joined the company. all are diaspora from the us and france.
employees said that the major shareholder dr. akeze teame opened another facility called american medical centre in 2012 that they claim has created a conflict of interest between the hospital and the centre, which runs a similar businesses. they claim that the facility has been poaching the hospital’s clients. they are requesting an independent audit report and further investigations into the company."
"the much expected igad meeting held in addis ababa to broker a peace deal between sudanese president salva kiir and his bitter rival, riek machar concluded without an agreement other than scheduling another talk in khartoum.
in statements ahead of the meeting held by the regional bloc, the intergovernmental authority on development (igad), the sudan people’s liberation movement-in-opposition (splm-io) rebel group, led by riek machar, called the current peace efforts “unrealistic” and warned that south sudan government forces were planning an attack on their troops in the country’s south.
“for any meaningful dialogue to take place, it should be within the context of a comprehensive political settlement, so that the guns can fall silent and a conducive environment for dialogue established,” splm-io said.
on the other hand martin elia, acting foreign minister said riek machar shouldn’t wait for an election if he wants to be president.
ethiopia’s prime minister abiy ahmed who is the chair person of igad warned the two sides to reach agreement and to restore peace in their country.
“how many agreement has been made so far ? yet, still no concerted action has been made. if the responsible parties in the countries are not willing to stop the suffering of their own citizens we  will take action to make peace which is our moral duty to help the people of south sudan.”
the last meeting between kiir and machar immediately preceded the outbreak of deadly fighting in the south sudanese capital juba in july 2016.
defeated, machar fled into exile in south africa where he was placed under de-facto house arrest.
at the same time, sudan announced that the two men would meet in three days for new talks in its capital, khartoum. south sudanese information minister michael makuei confirmed the meeting.
south sudan’s conflict started as a power struggle between the country’s political leaders before slipping into a broader feud between the two biggest ethnic groups, the nuer and the dinka.
more than a million people have fled their homes in south sudan since fighting broke out in december between government and rebel forces. president salva kiir says it was a coup attempt, blaming soldiers loyal to former vice-president riek machar for the trouble, but mr. machar denies this."
"companies ask government for amnesty to fulfill contracts  
local companies are struggling to supply materials needed for government mega projects within the required time period.
companies capital spoke with say lack of hard currency has prevented them from supplying construction materials for the projects. people working in the industry say this is another example of the hard currency crunch choking ethiopia’s economy. many manufacturers say they almost did not produce the entire year.
“now buyers are going to confiscate or annul the performance and bid bonds because companies failed to deliver on time,” a manager for a construction equipment company who asked to be anonymous told capital.
the project managers, particularly bureaus at the addis ababa city administration, are now notifying the companies that they will annul the agreements and confiscate the performance bonds, which usually amount to ten percent of contract’s total value.
the construction equipment manager pointed out that legally, lack of foreign currency is not a legitimate excuse for failing to deliver a product like a natural catastrophe or war is. in ethiopia’s commercial code a hard currency shortage is not considered a ‘force majeure’ or ‘act of god’.
“it was not an issue during the period when the code was ratified but now it is the country’s major economic challenge. the government should incorporate the issue into the law or facilitate hard currency,” an expert said.
“we have insisted that public institutions help us obtain hard currency to produce the materials and extend the deadline, but they have not supported us; the agreement has not taken this into consideration,” a company owner claimed.
this issue was one of the major topics of discussion at the metal industry development institute’s (midi) latest meeting, as the steel sector is a major victim of the forex shortage.
sources at the association of basic metals and engineering industries told capital that they have asked for help from the relevant government bodies and requested that public institutions consider the hard currency shortage to be a ‘force majeure’. “we have also recommended that they allow the contract to be fulfilled on an installment basis and allow factories to supply the product based on the amount of hard currency they have secured,” one of the industry actors said.
sources said that the midi wrote a letter to the city administration asking them to consider the foreign currency shortage and not penalize local manufacturers since they are important to ethiopia’s economy.
manufacturing industry representatives reportedly believe that the only source of hard currency for the sector, which is mainly engaged in import substitution, is accessed from state banks, particularly from the commercial bank of ethiopia. private banks; they argue, provide hard currency to those they have a ‘special relationship’ with.  they claim that even though the national bank of ethiopia has a directive forcing banks to prioritize manufacturing when approving hard currency the central bank has not been properly controlling the letter of credit approvals from private banks.
the hard currency shortage has affected the nation’s entire economic activity since the imbalance in earnings between hard currency and imports occurred. many manufacturers have shut down or scaled back operations."
"the crown prince of the united arab emirates (uae) marked his visit to ethiopia by agreeing to inject more foreign currency into the country, providing a boost to ethiopia’s manufacturing sector.
on day one of his two day official visit to addis ababa sheikh mohammed bin zayed bin sultan al-nahyan, the crown prince of abu dhabi and deputy supreme commander of the uae’s armed forces, met with pm abiy ahmed (phd) and president mulatu teshome (phd). pm abiy surprised many by driving the prince himself on the way from bole international airport to bole lemi industry park.according to the information disclosed on friday, the uae agreed to shoot usd one billion into the national coffer within few days. according to reports when pm abiy visited the gulf states recently, he convinced leaders to allocate ethiopia much needed cash.
in march the government reported there was less hard currency than expected and representatives from the manufacturing industry have reported on the dire effect lack of hard currency has on their ability to produce.
industries have suspended or reduced production or reportedly only have enough cash to operate for a few weeks.
now that help is on the way from the uae, industry representatives are asking the government to give them priority over public projects.
in the agreement the uae also promised to invest an additional usd 2 billion in different sectors.
the two countries have also agreed to waive visa conditions for diplomats of the two countries."
"the ministry of finance and economic cooperation (mofec) announced that since their new policy restricting ‘unnecessary expenditures’ was implemented 370 million birr has been returned to the public coffers. during his recent 2018/19 budget speech abraham tekeste (phd), minister of mofec, said that the new policy is saving the public a lot of money.
mofec has been strongly advocating for  public offices to use their budgets properly  and stated that for the most part they must hold events at their own venues as opposed to hotels or resorts.
since then federal offices have undertaken events in their own facilities at a minimal cost.
abraham said that public offices have been able to save on unnecessary costs. he said that since the new strategy was applied 370 million birr has been moved back from public offices to the coffer.
“now that the new strategy has been applied people have become more aware about the importance of saving but there is still waste that we need to cut we need to implement methods to tighten the controlling mechanism,” he said.
the minister stated that financial constraints have been observed on the current budget year which ends july 7. he said that some of the public projects have been postponed for another period due to lack of funds. in the budget year the government has been failed to collect over 50 billion birr that it planned to collect from taxes and related sources.
this year tax collection was 11.6 percent of the gdp, whereas last year it was nearly 13 percent.
the government is eager for taxes to be at least 17pct of gdp at the end of the gtp period in 2020.
at the end of the gtp period the government plans to earn half a trillion birr from taxes and related sources.
this coming fiscal year the budget tabled to parliament would increase by 3.6 percent which is a smaller rate than previous years. if the budget is compared with the preceding year in terms of hard currency it has decreased because the government has been applied a 15 percent devaluation on the birr from major hard currencies. mofec has tabled 347 billion birr for the upcoming fiscal year’s budget. the federal capital expenditure has declined by 4.4 percent or one billion birr compared with the current budget year. the debt settlement amount is 22.5 billion birr, which was 16 billion birr for the current year."
"the ministry of finance and economic cooperation (mofec) has tabled the 2018/19 budget at the parliament with a lower capital budget compared with the 2017/18 budget year.
in his 22 page budget speech abraham tekeste (phd), minister of mofec, tabled a proposal which will most likely be approved by the parliament before the end of the current budget year. the budget is   346.9 billion birr. this is a growth of 3.6 percent compared with the current budget year. even though the budget has shown a 12 billion birr increase it has significantly decreased compared with hard currency, which is the major resource for importing items.
accordingly in the 2017/18 budget year the government’s budget was usd 13.9 billion, which has now shrunk to usd 12.5 billion because of the 15 percent devaluation applied in october 2017.
even thought the government has approved 320 billion birr for this year the actual disbursement has been reduced by 50 billion birr according to the finance minister.
he said that for the budget year it has been targeted to collect over 200 billion birr from tax. “while the actual collection would not be expected to surpass 150 billion,” he said. for the current budget year several governmental projects have been transferred due to lack of the expected funds from tax.
the tax collection has been very weak, according to abraham. he stressed that the tax collection has to be closely followed for better performance.
the budget documents indicated that for the coming budget year the tax collection will be 211 billion birr. the external assistance and external loans are 19 billion and 32.7 billion birr respectively, while the balance is coming from different government investment and other incomes. the budget deficit is 2.3 percent of the gdp or 59.3 billion birr.
the capital budget for the federal government is 133.6 billion birr, which a reduction of 4.4 percent compared with the preceding year or over one billion birr. the capital budget reduction is an extraordinary situation for the sector since in the past it showed significant growth compared with the preceding year. the subsidy appropriation to regions has stood at 135.6 billion birr which is a  15.7 percent increase  compared with the preceding year and it is the 39 percent of the total budget, while the recurrent budget is 91.7 billion birr."
"the financial and insurance supervisory body, national bank of ethiopia (nbe), asked the ethiopian revenue and customs authority (erca) to unblock bank accounts of insurance companies that were blocked in relation to a dispute over customs guaranteed bond settlements.
the insurance companies and the revenue authority have been in disagreement since erca requested one billion birr from insurance firms who sold a customs guarantee bond to clients for the import of duty free equipment, mostly vehicles and construction machines, over the past decade.
reliable sources operating in the sector told capital that the nbe governor teklewold atnafu wrote a letter to the authority asking erca to lift its account freeze at banks until an amicable understanding could occur on the issue through the government’s involvement.
experts said that the central bank does not have the right to order or become involved in the authority’s operation but it has asked erca to diffuse the situation until a solution can be given by the relevant government agency.
“the disagreement intensified over the past few months and we have talked to nbe,” hadush hintsay, secretary general of the ethiopian insurance association (eia), told capital.
“a few weeks ago, through the involvement of nbe we met with officials from erca and an agreement was reached to alleviate the problem. however, erca has continued confiscating equipment, blocking accounts and taking money from insurer’s accounts,” hadush claimed.
he argued that the authority is undertaking the action based on invalid documents, settled issues and on bonds that closed many years ago.
the solution may not come from erca because it is the body that is asking for the funds at the same it is a judge for the case, according to the expert at the insurance industry. “they are using their power,” hadush claimed.
experts in the insurance industry who requested anonymity told capital that some of the payments demanded from erca goes back over 15 years. for example, it has asked an insurance firm to settle a customs guarantee bond issued about 19 years ago.
the issue has now affected the insurance business and pushed them to run under liquidity. some of the insurance leaders told capital that they are now having difficulty conducting business as usual because the authority froze their finance at banks.
“we have to settle the claim and at the same time collect premiums from clients but we have not been able to run these operations,” a leader of one of the pioneer insurance companies told capital.
a customer at another insurance company told capital that he cannot access his claim, even though the insurance company gave him a cheque to settle it. “i have tried to go to the bank to secure finance for the insurance claim but the bank told me that the account of the client’s insurance company was blocked by erca,” an insurance customer who demanded anonymity added.
hadush agreed with the insurance customer, he said that some of the insurance companies are unable to operate as usual.
he added that the money insurers hold is not their money. “erca should understand that it is the assets of the public that insurance companies use,” the association head said.
in its letter nbe said that despite the fact that an agreement was reached during a meeting held 4 weeks ago erca is continuing to take action against the insurers. the central bank has expressed its concerns that the action of erca may affect the activity of the insurance industry.
the central bank insisted that the authority halt its measures until the government hands down a final decision about the issue.
even though capital got confirmation from the association and insurers that nbe wrote a letter to erca, it is unable to confirm this from erca.
ephrem mekonnen, public relations head of erca, told capital the letter was not received by relevant offices at erca, but he did confirm that one of the insurance firms sued erca in relation to the issue.
insurers claimed the actions of erca are completely unacceptable since most of the cases have expired.
experts said that erca can claim bonds within a specified period, but it is now is requesting expired bonds. in addition, some of the claims have already cleared and the companies who got the guarantee left the country.
asseged gebremedhin, expert on the insurance industry and deputy ceo of operations at the national insurance company of ethiopia, told capital that the current actions taken  by erca may affect investment and development in the country. he said that a time bar is given for all bonds, while erca is requesting claims that have already passed their statute of limitations.  “these actions also impact the country’s hard currency generation since investment and business are affected,” he argued.
according to the procedure, the equipment or machines, which are mainly imported by multinational companies with projects in the country, are imported duty free via a customs guarantee bond where they have to re-export within 180 days after the end of the statute of limitations of the bond.  experts said that erca is responsible for following the process and making claims on time and ensuring that the imported equipment was not re-exported within 180 days after the end of the guarantee.
however, if the importer sold the equipment here before the expiration of the agreement, then the customs duty has to be settled. according to the usual trend the maximum customs guarantee bond time bar is less than 10 years.
the customs proclamation issued in 2014 in its article 117, sub article 2 stated that the authority shall demand a security bond ‘to ensure the re-exportation of goods imported on a temporary basis without payment of duties and taxes or, in case of default, to ensure the payment of the duties and taxes’.
the proclamation article 119 sub article 3 indicates that where the debtor fails to discharge his or her obligations the guarantor shall immediately effect the payment.
“we claimed that we are not liable for the claims when time frame has expired,” asseged told capital.
“the authority is responsible for making claims legally through the courts as opposed to confiscating  the property of individuals and blocking bank accounts,” according to zafu eyessueswork, a prominent expert on the insurance and finance industry.
he says that the current operation is illegal since they haven’t followed appropriate legal procedures. he agreed  that some members of the private sector are involved in illegal activities, but at the same time the bond is crucial for the development of the country.
“as far i know most equipment is re-exported during the allowed time frame, and bonds are usually given during the appropriate time frame,” he added.
some of the insurance leaders claimed that the operation of erca goes against customs proclamation no. 859/2014 issued four years ago. “according to the proclamation erca is only able to block the bank account for ten days and it must obtain court authorization but now this is not happening,” a ceo of an insurance company told capital.
“before their claim they have to come up with their proof that the debtors have not settled the duty or re-exported or damaged the products,” he added."
"people working in the construction industry say the government should open up the financial sector and find better skilled administrators so as to deal with the existing severe shortage of hard currency in the country. at a workshop organized by the ethiopian civil engineers association (ecea) under the theme:‘the role of banks and insurance companies in the sustainable development of the construction industry in ethiopia,’ participants said the government is not prioritizing construction when it comes to accessing finance.
even though the construction sector is ethiopia’s largest employer after agriculture it does not receive priority access to loans.
“industry makes up 23 percent of the gdp and from that amount 75 percent comes from construction,” noted a participant.
construction in ethiopia has deteriorated over the past couple of years, according to tsedeke yihune (eng), head and owner of flintstone construction, one of the workshop’s speakers.
according to him revenue from construction decreased 60 percent this year and 40 percent the year before.
he told capital that it is obvious construction has declined as seen in the amount the sector has paid in taxes that has been consistently decreasing over the years.
tsedeke told journalists that this year the construction sector has not been able to access any significant amount of finance because exports and manufacturing have been prioritized and the hard currency shortage has deeply hindered construction.
he claims there is enough liquidity and hard currency in the national reserve and cash in banks.
“my colleagues and me believe that the problem is lack of administrational capacity or interest in the political economy,” he explained.
he thinks that there is not really a shortage of hard currency because up to 20 percent of the gdp is hard currency reserve and the remittance in 2016/17 was usd 6.5 billion, “so how has the hard currency shortage occurred?” he asked.
he said the root challenge of ethiopia’s financial system is administration.
aisha mohammed (eng), minister of construction, told capital that it needs further study before declaring where the problem lies.
“the government states that there is a hard currency shortage in the country,” she said.
“as the title of the workshop states, we have seen the role the financial industry plays in the construction sector development and the growth of the country,” tesfaye workineh (eng), president of eace and managing director of united consulting engineers plc (unicone) said.
he added that the main goals of the association are trainings and increasing the skills, professionalism, achievement, ethics and loyaltyof those working in the construction sector.
zafu eyessuswork, united bank, board of directors chairperson and eminent expert on the financial and insurance sector and the other presenter at the workshop, said that financial sector’s regulatory body needs to improve its capacity.
“the regulation is extremely high and sometimes its looks like it is applied with a lack of expertise,” he said. he elaborated it may reflect the infancy of the financial industry which opened up around 25 years ago.
“in relation to the formation of new private banks one should not forget that their leaders came from government banks and their role model is a monopoly,” zafu said.
some also claimed that there is fraud in both the financial and construction sectors. “we have to clean our own house and at the same time solve the problem in the financial industry,” one of the participants said.
“our banks need more time to provide project finance in the country,” the financial expert said. he thinks private banks have too little capital and not enough grasp about competition.
“this workshop is targeted to create awareness about the current challenges in the finance and construction sectors and specific ways to solve problems,” he added.
he told journalists that the civil engineering sector also needs to improve its expertise in the finance world.
the ethiopian civil engineers and architects association was formed 55 years ago. about 20 years ago it separated into two and the ethiopian civil engineers association came into being.
the association is engaged in training and awareness creation workshops for its members and works with relevant government bodies to alleviate challenges faced in the construction sector. for instance it has signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of construction, whereby the association will provide input about new and existing rules and regulations after conducting research and reviewing scientific journals.
according to tesfaye (eng) the association will have at least two additional events before the end of the current ethiopian year. “and they will help new graduates and professionals enhance their skills,” the president added.
the workshop was opened by aisha mohammed (eng), minister of construction, and held at eca."
"the council of ministers in its regular meeting on saturday june 2 lift the state of emergency that was imposed on february 15, right after the resignation of the previous prime minister hailemariam dessalegn. the draft law will be sent to parliament for approval by next week.
according to a tweet from fitsum arega chief of staff at the prime minister office the lift came after the security situation in the country is back to normal. ‘the council of ministers in its regular meeting reviewed the security situation of the country. it noted that law and order has been restored. it has approved a draft law that lifts the state of emergency. the draft will be sent to parliament for its consideration’ reads the tweet.
the lifting of the state of emergency was widely expected after the new prime minister, abiy ahmed came to power. however it took him exactly two months to lift the emergency decree after he took power.
ethiopia announced a state of emergency on february 15, a day after the prime minister resigned, as pressure mounted on the country’s ruling coalition. the coalition decided emergency rule was ‘vital to safeguarding the constitutional order’.
the country fully lifted its last state of emergency in august 2017, following months of curfews, restrictions on movement and the detention of thousands of people.
those measures followed two years of anti-government protests in which security forces killed hundreds of people in amhara and oromia regions, the nation’s two most populous provinces.
eprdf has been in power since 1991 and controls all 547 seats in parliament. but cracks have appeared since the outbreak of unrest, with some senior officials resigning and others being sidelined."
"in its highest procurement period in the last few years the ethiopian sugar corporation has floated another round of sugar bidding with a huge volume. the bid is for the third time in the budget year.
the international bid that the corporation announced a week ago indicated that it is looking to buy 200,000 tons of cane sugar.
the maximum production in the history of the corporation was 4 million quintals per annum in the 2015/16 budget year. last budget year the annual production was 4.5 million quintals. according to the survey conducted by the sugar corporation the current demand is from 6 to 6.5 million quintals per annum.
due to the gap between the demand and actual local production the corporation has imported 200,000 metric tons of sugar per annum.
however this year imports have significantly increased.
gashaw ayecheluhem, public relations head at the corporation, told capital that the el nino and la nina effects have affected production. “the instability followed by burning  sugarcane farms at wonji and arjo dedesa and suspending the production at fincha have significantly hindered our ability to produce a lot of sugar  this year,” he said.
he said that the delay of the expected new factories has also affected the volume.
“the instability has significantly affected the production at some of the factories, for instance fincha suspended its production for months when it was unable to transport the sugar in produced and ended up staying at a congested warehouse during the  instability period,” he said.
“the rain also caused some other factories to not start on time,” he added.
according to gashaw, omo kuraz ii, which is one of the new factories constructed by the chinese company complant, has suspended its production because of unexpected rainfall. kuraz ii commenced its trial test last budget year and suspended production due to the rainfall and is still not operating.
in december 2017 and march 2018 the corporation bought 100,000 metric tons each to alleviate the sugar shortage.
with the current purchase, ethiopia will have imported 400,000 metric tons in a single budget year. the sugar being bought now will be transported during the coming budget year.
according to gashaw, the 200,000 metric tons of sugar will be distributed from september to december in  the coming budget year that starts on july 8.
according to the bid document, the procurement volume will be decreased based on the production performance of the factories.
“if the factories are doing well the volume in the latest bid will be reduced,” he added.
the 100,000 metric ton sugar bid opened in march and is expected to begin transportation june through august, which is the second month of the coming budget year (2018/19).
in the end of the budget year the corporation purchased only 70,000 metric tons of sugar, which was distributed last october.
the sugar shortage is not new to the country. for the past several years the government has allocated millions of usd to import the sweet.
in the beginning of the past growth and transformation plan (gtp i), which started in 2010 and ended in 2015, the government announced the commencement of ten sugar factory projects that were expected to be finalized before the end of the five year period. hopes are that the new sugar factories will allow the country to halt sugar imports and enable it to earn more than usd 600 million from exports by the end of the first gtp.
however almost all of them have been delayed beyond the scheduled time and the country continues to allocate scarce hard currency to import the product, which is also source of input for several industries.
currently some of the projects are on in the testing stage and the majority are under construction.
compared with the past two years the current purchase is very huge.
in 2015 the corporation purchased 275,000 and 300,000 tons in 2016, while the july and 2017 purchase, were 170,000 tones.
the corporation planned to cut sugar imports as of the past budget year and it has unsuccessfully attempted to export sugar to kenya.
in the previous bid that opened in march ed and f man, agro corp, sukden, al khaleej, baitak development and antei international were selected as the final competitors to supply sugar  from june to august. ed and f man, who won the bid, are expected to transport the sugar for  local consumption until august.
in december al khaleej won the bid for 100,000 metric tons of sugar purchased by the corporation, sukden supplied the 70,000 metric tons in the beginning of the budget year.
from seven operational factories kuraz ii and arjo dedesa, who lost 2,100 hectare of sugar cane during the  unrest, are not active.
according to gashaw, so far in the budget year the corporation imported 295,000 metric tons of sugar and imported another 110,000 metric tons that ed and f man will supply for the end of the current budget year and the beginning of 2018/19 budget year.
every month the corporation supplies 600,000 million quintals of sugar to the local market  and manufacturing industry.
sugar factories are expected to perform maintenance during this rainy season."
"after two years of heading the policy bank, development bank of ethiopia (dbe), getahun nana, former vice-governor of the national bank of ethiopia (nbe), submitted his resignation letter mid this week to the prime minister office.
according to sources, getahun seemed ready and intending to leave his coveted post at the dbe where he had replaced esayas bahre, who left in 2016 after being suspended from his post.
meanwhile, experts in the finance sector speculate that getahun may be headed for the nbe governor’s post.
getahun, before joining dbe, was one of the longest serving financial sector watchdogs at the central bank and served as a vice governor of the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) for seven years. later he was appointed by the then prime minister hailemariam desalegn to revive dbe.
at dbe, the levels of non-performing loans (npl) has declined from 28 percent to 20.54 percent in the current fiscal year. from the total npl basket, the majority is accounted for by two sectors: manufacturing and commercial farming. as of january, 2018, dbe’s npl level is 8.6 billion birr. still the npl of the bank remained above the 15 percent maximum cap set by the national bank of ethiopia.
dbe is a specialized state owned development financial institution, which is supervised by the public financial enterprises agency.
the development bank of ethiopia was the first development finance institution in ethiopia and as such it was designed to assist in the development of industrial and agricultural production and foster the investment of private capital for productive purposes
the goal of this bank is to promote economic development via financing commerce, industry, agriculture, and manufacturing. each period of ethiopian political history has used the bank for different purposes. thus, the bank has changed its name several times.
the removal of esayas, which was at the time largely related with a controversial finding by a study conducted in the office of the prime minister that exposed the misuse of loans disbursed to commercial farms, particularly in gambella region among others has put the bank in a limelight."
"midroc gold mine plc is asking for an additional impact study at its gold mine in lega dembi. they want it to include the area surrounding the gold mine and to be expedited within the shortest period possible.
the company is currently the only major high scale precious metal producer in ethiopia. however the company suspended production after its license was revoked two weeks back.
residents in the area complain that the mining negatively impacts human and animal health. the company stated that it is using the chemical, called cyanide, which is used for gold mining worldwide, and added that the chemical is proven that it does not have any effect in the environment.
in the statement that the company sent to capital, it stated that it wrote a letter to the ministry of mines, petroleum and gas (mmpng) saying it attempted to the public’s attention that the use of cyanide does not have a negative impact on the health of babies and mothers.
a few weeks ago the ministry placed a temporary suspension on mining to conduct additional studies on its impact.
the statement that the company sent to capital indicated that midroc gold expressed its desire for the study to include the areas outside the mining location.
“the company has accordingly complied with the order of mmpng by stopping its production activities and has requested the ministry to expedite the additional study,” the statement that the company sent to capital explained.
“every single day without production has a negative effect on the country’s foreign currency earnings,” the company said.
it has also elaborated that considering the negative impact and the financial loss each unproductive day hinders the moral of the workers. “mirdoc gold mine requested the relevant ministry to conclude the study being undertaken in the shortest period possible,” it added.
midroc gold mine is a company under midroc group, one of the groups that the billionaire sheik mohammed hussein ali al-amoudi owns.
currently, ethiopia has a single large-scale gold mine, the midroc gold mine at lega dembi, shakisso, oromia regional state, which is an operating open pit mine in ethiopia.
the mine was privatized and awarded to midroc ethiopia in 1997. a mining license was awarded and a new company – midroc legadembi gold mine share company (midroc gold) commenced production in august 1998. the lega dembi deposit is the largest gold producer in ethiopia."

"ethiopia’s bottled water business is feeling the pinch of the hard currency shortage and an imbalance between a growing number of bottlers and lack of needed ‘inputs’ for the bottled water.
bottled water companies have cut production and working hour shifts and consumers have noticed a shortage of bottled water in the capital city recently.
distributers capital interviewed reported a shortage of bottled water over the last week.
“in the last few days i have finished the entire distribution between 8 and 10 am. normally it would take me the entire day to finish distributing the water,” a sales person told capital. the product is usually delivered on medium sized pickup trucks.
shemeles ajema, sales manager at abebe dinku water & non-alcoholic industry, producer of top water, said that in recent years the bottled water market grew by 13 percent but this year the bottled water industry has grown by 38 percent.
“in the past three quarters of the budget year nine new water bottlers joined the market and some of the existing factories have expanded their capacity and seven additional new companies are expected to begin operating in the next four months,” the water sector expert, who consult several new water bottlers, said.
he said that the growing demand for bottled water has encouraged more investors. now there are 67 water bottling companies in the country, with most of them focused on central ethiopia.
by the next ethiopian new year expectations are that number will increase to 74 bottled water companies. not only are there more new companies but existing producers are significantly expanding their production capacity and installing new lines, according to experts in the business.
“even though the number of bottlers have increased significantly, product scarcity has been observed in the market,” an expert said.
shemeles argued that currently the limited number of input producers and the hard currency shortage has forced factories to use 46 percent of their capacity on average.
he said that a label or polysheet scarcity in the market would force the bottlers to suspend their production.
water bottlers say some factories have been forced to limit the types of products they offer for example producing only a half litter or one litter bottle because they have limited access to inputs.
the capacity of input suppliers is not enough to cover the demand of the existing bottlers and at the same time new producers are also looking for more inputs.
some of those who are involved in the sector are also claiming that some of the input suppliers are also hording the inputs due to frequent price increases of raw material.
“producers are not growing as much as the bottlers. maybe the number of input producers has increased by only two or three,” experts said.
experts added that in the past few months the price of inputs has significantly increased. “in the past couple of months the price of inputs has increased by up to 80 percent”.
since the prices keep rising the suppliers have become more cautions and are hoarding products and evaluating the market, according to experts. the input price increase has been observed on the international market as well. locally the increase in prices has been attributed to the devaluation of the birr.
“this is likely the reason for the decrease in production in the water industry,” shemeles said.
the current situation has also frustrated the water bottlers, as they have not raised water prices despite the rising prices of inputs.
“about one birr increased on the price of a raw single bottle but bottlers have increased only a penny on their single bottled water,” the expert said.
in the past two months the water bottlers have revised their price on the packed product, while experts argue that it is incomparable with the increase in input prices.
experts said that the sector has created at least 20,000 jobs, but they argue that the government considers it a luxury business.
“since the government does not considered it a priority industry the sector is not getting adequate attention in relation to hard currency allocation and controlling the hoarding,” experts added.
experts argue that the bottlers have to work jointly to convince the government and secure benefits that they give to others sectors.
shemeles said that some of the bottlers are now working to form an association to represent the sector."
"the palestinian ambassador to ethiopia, nasir abujaish who is furious about the recent shift of the american embassy to jerusalem asked for support from other countries in opposing the recent move.
“we saw that some countries who were opposed to moving the us embassy to the occupied jerusalem  territory  attended the celebration  in jerusalem and witness the move of the us  embassy. this is unfair” he said in a briefing on tuesday, may 15.
the move on monday followed a december 2017 decision by us president donald trump to recognize jerusalem as israel’s capital and relocate the us mission there from tel aviv. representatives from countries like tanzania, kenya, angola, and albania attended the celebration despite recently stating opposition to the move. reports also said that ethiopia was among those that attended the ceremony. ethiopia’s ministry of foreign affairs said despite media reports, its delegates did not participate in the opening celebrations of the us embassy in jerusalem. in a statement meles alem, mofa spokesperson, clarified that media reports indicating ethiopia as one of the african countries which were planning to participate in the event were not true. the news was first reported by haaretz, a leading israeli daily newspaper. nigeria and thailand, which were included in the report by haaretz, have also issued statements saying their delegates were not part of the opening ceremony.
capital asked the ambassador if shifting the us embassy to jerusalem will motivate others to do the same thing.
“i don’t think so, but if they will do that we will oppose it because we will not accept jerusalem without palestine.”
he said that the ongoing massacre in the gaza strip which happened last week was planned in advance, since the protests began on march 30.
“the israeli officials and the american president and his advisor are accountable for committing war crimes against the defenseless palestine people. many times we warned that president trump’s decision will have repercussions on the stability of the region in particular and the world in general. it will also expand the cycle of violence in the world and in the  middle east region, especially its impact on the spiritual, cultural and historical status of the holy city in the islamic and christian conscience .’’
the status of jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to forging a peace deal between israel and the palestinians, who with broad international backing want east jerusalem, captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war, as their capital.
israel regards the entire city, including the eastern sector it annexed after the 1967 conflict, as its capital. the trump administration has said the city’s final borders should be decided by the parties.
palestinians have been demonstrating on the gaza frontier for the past six weeks, demanding a return to family land or homes lost to israel when it was founded in the 1948 middle east war."
"big pharmaceutical representation offices are closing their offices after the country is hit with severe shortage of foreign currency. these offices are said to be hit hard by the lack of foreign currency they are forced to downsize their employment forces in the last two years.
sources told capital that glaxosmithkline plc, (gsk) which is one of the companies involved in the pharmaceuticals sector is going to close its office by the end of this month. moreover bayer ag, a german multinational pharmaceutical company and sandoz a subsidiary of novatris a global healthcare company based in switzerland, are also having difficulty due to the shortage of forex.
christian hartel, head of corporate media relations at bayer declined to comment to capital about their current status in ethiopia. “we ask for your understanding that we cannot comment on your questions” hartel replied to an emailed questions. gsk also declined to comment until we went to the printing press.
another company sanofi s.a. a french multinational pharmaceutical company is also in the brink of closing if the situation continues to persist.
kassahun tesfaye country manager of sanofi said that his office is in grave danger of survival because of the shortage of the foreign currency.
“it has been over a year since we requested for a foreign currency and nothing has come up until now. we import some basic medicines for diabetics and epileptic patients. however due to the shortage it is become very difficult to continue our operation” kassahun told capital.
he further said that if it continues like this for the next two or three months our fate is to close down our office. “we cannot continue like this. operational cost of the office is now higher that that we trade. so how can we go on like this? our only choice is to close down our office” he added.
“last year in february we applied for usd 800,000 worth of lc but we only get usd 70,000, which is a mere 10 percent of the total money we want, i have to distribute lifesaving children epileptics medicine with a ration to pharmacies” kassahun said.
“i receive calls daily from desperate parents of patients about the children epileptics’ medicine, which we solely supply, it is personally very hard for me to answer these calls” he said.
the local pharmaceuticals industry is also facing a serious shortage of raw materials, as well as serious financial difficulties, as a result of the ongoing foreign currency crisis.
the prevailing foreign currency shortage was impacting negatively on the importation of critical medicines and ingredients used for manufacturing various drugs as well as packaging material. these factories are also producing way below capacity.
some of these multinational were also planning to open up pharmaceutical plants in the country.
dr allan pamba, gsk’s vice-president, pharmaceuticals, east africa and government affairs, back 2015 said that gsk had completed its investment plans to set up a pharmaceuticals factory in ethiopia and partner with addis ababa university in the areas of pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and healthcare delivery.
total demand for the pharmaceuticals industry is estimated to stand between 400 million dollars and 500 million dollars a year.
in its report published in january 2018, the imf signaled that the forex problem is far from being resolved, indicating that the international currency reserve has dwindled to the level of only being able to cover 1.8 months of the import bill of the nation.
the shortage of the foreign currency started to be seen starting in early 2017, the situation seriously deteriorated after mid – 2017. measures such as the devaluation of the birr by 15 percent against major foreign currencies were also introduced to curb the shortage but to no avail.
the devaluation was followed by a couple of directives issued by the national bank of ethiopia (nbe), including ordering private banks to transfer 30 percent of their forex earnings to the accounts of nbe and allowing exporters to retain 30 percent of the forex they generate, up from 10 percent.
the nbe also increased the list of items which are prioritized for foreign currency allocation. petroleum, agricultural machines, fertilizer, medicines and supplement food were the items which received priority.
the government has also collaborated with the world health organization (who) and launched the national strategy and plan of action for pharmaceutical manufacturing development in ethiopia. this plan was expected to increase pharmaceutical production in the country, improve medicine quality, and strengthen the national medicine regulatory system.
there is a plethora of ethiopian and non-ethiopian pharmaceutical companies offering generic and branded medication."
"with the increasing number of ethiopian business people who import different product from china, getting a chinese visa is becoming increasingly difficult. one must wake up early in the morning to line up at the embassy but if you are lazy and is not a morning person you have to pay up to 1,000 birr to get a front line at the gate of the embassy.
currently up to one hundred ethiopians go to the embassy daily to get a visa but the long lines forced them to hire someone who wake up early and process their visa for 1,000 birr. the embassy told capital that they will investigate the case.
majority of ethiopians go to china to import clothes, shoes, medicine and electronic devices. in the last fiscal year the majority of imports for the country came from china."
"a recent study conducted by the addis ababa city fire, emergency prevention and rescue agency disclosed that 121,000 houses in addis, including 1,000 government and private institutions are in locations vulnerable to flood disasters.
the study which took six months to complete identified 143 areas as having a high risk of flooding. it recommended that homes there be relocated or reconstructed to avoid a potential disaster that could take thousands of lives and potentially damage 4.5 billion birr in property.
a majority of the risky places are in gullele and nifas silk sub cities where houses are constructed near rivers and drainage sites.
the agency, which is notifying home owners who are at risk, initially identified 53 flood prone areas but recently added 90 places to that number after another investigation.
source in the agency told capital that many houses should be removed to save them from flood disaster.
“the housing shortfall is likely to increase vulnerability to flood events amongst three specific social groups. first, many people have been forced to live in squatter sites where no formal physical or social infrastructure is available and tenure is insecure. second, the low values of rentals obtained relative to maintenance costs has meant that households in the public and private rental sectors may suffer from especially poor physical environments. third, housing demand has encouraged house owners to sub-divide properties (leading to the creation of vulnerable “bottom houses”.
riversides in addis ababa have been a source of worry for residents in their precipices. the areas have been dogged by landslides, pollution and lack of development for ages. but due to a spate of development activities around ten of them, that might change soon.
the research found that addis ababa rivers and riversides face problems which include: badly polluted segments through direct discharge of domestic waste generated mainly from households and institutions; river bank erosion; and inaccessible rivers and riversides.
un figures show that this year alone, 117 million people around the world have suffered from some 300 natural disasters brought about by climate change, including devastating droughts in china and africa, and massive flooding in asia and africa, costing nearly usd 15 billion in damages. this included addis ababa.
last year there were 76 floods in the city, damaging houses and properties worth 20 million birr. flooding also claimed the life of one man who lived in nifas silk lafto sub – city. the figures are twice as many as last year."
"the federal ethics and anti corruption commission (feacc) expressed its distress with lack of adequate office facility after it moved out of their old office located around the area commonly known as lagar.
the commission that moved to a building located behind hilton hotel on tito street, claimed that it is unable to properly manage its operation and file the documents of the registered asset of public officials.
on the 14 the executives national anticorruption coalition meeting held at the sheraton addis, participants and officials of the commission frequently expressed their concern about the challenge that the commission faces.
one of the participants that represent one organization stated that it has to be clear whether the government wanted this organization to continue or not.
since november last year the commission moved to its new office after the newly established government housing corporation took over its building that uses to house the commission since its establishment.
“they are the owner of the building, but the commission has to have a proper facility to operate its activity normally,” one of the participants said.
ayelign mulualem, commissioner of feacc, who comes to the position in november, told capital that his organization expressed its concern to the relevant government offices like the office of the prime minister and ministry of finance and economic cooperation (mofec). “the current pm is new for the post but we have expressed our concern for mofec strongly,” he added.
“we have several documents related with asset disclosure and registration that do not get proper storage area,” he said.
ayelign who was chief administrator of the north gondar zone and head of health bureau of the amhara region, said that one of the missions of the commission is creating awareness to fight corruption, however there is no proper venue to give trainings for different segment of the public.
“currently our commission has several responsibilities at the continental and international stages but we could not host our guests from abroad at our office,” the commissioner said. “if we hosted them in this facility it is a bad image for the country and it may give an image that the government do not give proper attention for fighting corruption,” he says.
the problem has forced the commission to host guests at hotels.
officers at the commission said that part of the equipment of feacc still remains in the previous building. the commissioner argued that the current building of feacc was not constructed for office purpose. he said that it was built for shop and residential facilities, which makes it difficult for them."

the ethiopian art industry particularly the paintings and sculptures sector has been affected by recent political instability and public unrest.
on a panel discussion titled ‘art and its economic benefit for artists, other actors and the country’ organized by crown publishing plc, publisher of capital newspaper, representatives of the art industry stated that the art industry and galleries has been affected with the recent instability in the country.
on the discussions that attracts the media, artists and promoters, seyoum ayalew, the outgoing president of the ethiopian painters and sculptors association said that the instability affected the tourism flow in the country.
“our major clients are tourists and foreigners and the art market slowed in the past couple of years,” he said.
experts said that several art galleries including asni gallery, which is one of the prominent galleries for tourists in the town closed its doors.
“they have tried to survive by subsidizing it, but they couldn’t continue anymore,” seyoum said.
several other studios including the famous five arts studio established by artists was also closed due to financial reasons, according to the president of the association.
besides that he argued that the sector does not have clear and knowledge based support and acknowledgement from the government.
“we are struggling to survive, while at the same time looking different kind of support to make the art industry one of the economic and social welfare contributor for the country,” seyoum said.
besides the workshop seyoum told capital that the art industry is one of the sources of tourist attraction for the country. “in 2014 addis ababa has been placed as one of the best tourist destination city in the world by new york times. in its article the new york times stated that addis ababa is a centre for hosting art exhibition every week and galleries in the town are performing very well. this is a good indication how the art industry contributed for the tourism and economy,” he added.
the new york times ‘52 places to go in 2014’ stated “thanks to the city’s diverse art institutions and galleries, including the artist-in-residence village zoma contemporary art center and the asni gallery (really more of an art collective than a gallery), there is an art opening at least once a week. even the local sheraton puts on “art of ethiopia,” an annual show of new talent.”
in the panel discussion held on may 1, 2018, at yucca house in the sidelines of the tesfahun kibru’s art exhibition, the art industry actors insisted that media houses and journalists should give proper attention for the sector.
it was also mentioned that journalists have to have proper knowledge to provide ample coverage for the art industry in general.
it has been claimed that even though the music and now the cinema sub sectors contribute for the economy it is stated that they are also very limited.
it was stated that in the emperor era the sector has been supported by the financial sector and secured loan. “like the trend of other countries paints are considered as collateral like other assets,” seyoum, one of the panelists on the discussion said.
he argued that exchange market like ethiopian commodity exchange has to be formed to boost the sector and make more beneficiaries for the artists and related actors."
"a recent report from the world food program shows that 7.88 million people in ethiopia will require food assistance in 2018 and the somali region remains to be the epicenter of the drought, with an estimated 1.8 million people in need of lifesaving food assistance.
the update report states that there are an estimated 1.7 million internally displaced persons (idps) in ethiopia, of which, an estimated 461,000 conflict induced idps are in the somali region.
currently, the wfp is providing emergency relief assistance to the somali region while the government of ethiopia and the joint emergency operation program an ngo consortium provide relief assistance to the rest of the country.
according to the report, the 1.7 million idps in the somalia region was driven by factors ranging from conflict, environmental degradation, natural and manmade disasters, changing livelihood strategies in an evolving political economy, poverty, and progressive depletion of coping mechanisms available to the displaced and host communities.
it further states that below-average spring rains, combined with extremely low household livestock holdings, suggest the ongoing food security situation in south-eastern ethiopia will continue through most of 2018. sustained, large-scale assistance is needed to mitigate the risk of increases in acute malnutrition and a further deterioration of outcomes, particularly in the somali region.
currently, wfp’s emergency relief assistance in the somali region comprises of a combination of food and cash based modalities, depending on system readiness, nutritional needs and where markets function. the report also states that the re-targeting and registration of beneficiaries that will receive cash and/or food transfers under the 2018 hdrp is ongoing.
according to the humanitarian disaster resilience plan released in march by the ethiopian government and humanitarian partners, most of the 2017 humanitarian needs are carried over into 2018 given insufficient recovery opportunities, compounded by the underperformance of the 2017 autumn rains; the prevalence of risk factors for communicable disease outbreaks such as awd and measles; as well as large scale displacement due to drought and conflict.
the appeal seeks usd 1.66 billion to reach 7.88 million people with emergency food/cash and non-food assistance, mainly in the southern and south-eastern parts of the country. due to many other humanitarian crisis around the world, meeting the needed funding will be a challenge, it has been said."

"the 2017 human right report of the us department of state has detailed very harsh measures against human right in the country.
the 39 page dossier details every aspects of human right issue and mainly focused on basic right abuse in the year 2017.
however the embassy of the us in addis ababa expressed its hope for a better achievement in the current year.
the embassy that issued a statement following the us department of state 2017 human rights report for ethiopia, stated that the 2017 human rights report for ethiopia reflects serious challenges to the ethiopian people’s ability to exercise their basic rights last year.
“we believe there is reason for optimism that the 2018 human rights report will tell a different story, one of progress,” the embassy said in a statement expressing its hope.
“notwithstanding the ongoing state of emergency, about which we have already expressed our views, 2018 has seen positive steps as well, including the release of thousands of prisoners. we are also encouraged by strong and clear statements by prime minister abiy regarding the need for reforms that would ensure ethiopian’s rights are protected and that they are able to participate in an inclusive political environment,” the statement added.
in its dossier with seven sections the state department has compiled the abuses recorded by international and local agencies and organization that occurred in the past year.
it has claimed that the government does not take measures on those who abuse human rights under its system.
“the government generally did not take steps to prosecute or otherwise punish officials who committed human rights abuses other than corruption,” it said. it added that impunity was a problem; there was an extremely limited number of prosecutions of security force members or officials for human rights abuses during the year.
it argued that impunity remained a serious problem, including impunity for killings and other violence against protesters.
the report further states that there were no public reports whether internal investigations of the federal police for possible abuses during the state of emergency (soe) occurred. it reminded that the ethiopian human rights commission (ehrc) that stated in april last year that security forces used excessive force in some localities in oromia and amhara regions. it added that the commission did not publicly release its report.
the dossier also said that the government rarely publicly disclosed the results of investigations into abuses by local security forces, such as arbitrary detention and beatings of civilians.
it stated that authorities regularly detained persons arbitrarily, including protesters, journalists, and opposition party members. it quoted the local human right non-governmental organization report that it said the may human right commission (hrco) report stated authorities illegally detained 22,525 persons during the soe.
the us report has also amplified its concern on the legal system in the country particularly in the criminal cases.
“the law provides for an independent judiciary. although the civil courts operated with a large degree of independence, criminal courts remained weak and overburdened and subject to political influence,” it explained.
in its harsh report against the ethiopian human right condition it has also stated that there were an unknown number of political prisoners and detainees at year’s end. “throughout the year the government detained journalists, activists, and political opposition members, although not explicitly on political grounds. the most common charges against journalists, activists, or opposition politicians were terrorism via the anti-terrorism proclamation (atp), participation in a proscribed terrorist group, incitement, and outrage against the constitution or the constitutional order,” it added.
“corruption, especially the solicitation of bribes, including police and judicial corruption, remained a problem,” the report added. “some stakeholders believed government officials manipulated the land allocation process and state or party owned businesses received preferential access to land leases and credit. the law mandates that the federal attorney general investigate and prosecute corruption cases,” the report stated.
when the latest state of emergency was imposed in mid-february, the us was the first to oppose it. such kind of criticism was not seen from the us, which is one of the major allies of the ethiopian government."
"going to work in factories near them, engage in domestic works, abduction and other harmful traditional practices let 3,862 students to drop their schools in oromia finfine special zones.
the schools which are found in the surrounding areas of addis ababa enroll 123,000 students and have 3,700 teachers. these schools are also hit by high teachers turnovers that leave their job for a better job in other parts of the country.
from the student who left there schools 2,043 of them are boys and the rest are girls and compared to the last fiscal year the number drops by 5.7 percent. the last fiscal year dropout rates were 8.9 percent.
ferekia kassahun, head of oromia finnfine special zones education bureau told capital that much work is needed to be done to decrease the dropout rates.
“poverty, availability, and accessibility are three big reasons why children drop out of school,” says ferekia. “when a family is not financially secure, prioritizing a child’s education takes a backseat. distance to school is also another reason. parents deem it unsafe for a child, especially girls, to travel far. this validated in dropout rates as well, which rise sharply after primary class.’’
“failure to complete a basic cycle of primary school not only limit future opportunities for children but also represents a significant drain on the limited resources that the country have for the provision of primary education.’’
he further said more had to be done in providing proper education. “however, despite the noted milestone that have been achieved by the government, we are concerned with challenges being faced by children due to the economic hardship prevailing in some families, resulting in increased number of school dropouts, leading children in some instances to being forced into early marriages,”
he added that his bureau is working with stakeholders to raise the awareness of parents to reduce the dropout of students.
six woredas and one city administration are under oromia finfine special zones education bureau but lack of water, electricity, health facilities still hampers the operation of these schools.
currently 294 primary, 19 elementary and 6 preparatory schools are operational in oromia finfine special zones."
"the ethiopian grain trade enterprise (egte) which distributes wheat to ethiopia’s nine regions and two administrations is running out of stock due to delayed procurement of wheat from abroad.
the enterprise had been distributing 640,000 quintals per month to trade bureaus, universities, and prison administrations and has only 50,000 quintals remaining in its stock which has caused them to delay this month’s distribution.
currently four million quintals of wheat are under the procurement process but it will take over two months before this reaches egte.
egte, out of concern, has requested one million metric tons of wheat as a loan from the emergency food security reserve administration (efsra).
however they have not gotten a response, so the agency has made a second request, this time to the national disaster risk management commission (ndrmc) which did approve an unspecified amount of wheat.
due the shortage egte cut the supply of wheat by 50 percent last month. they have also been purchasing wheat from the local market for between 1,000-1,200 birr per quintal.
a source at the enterprise told capital that shortages of bread and other products could occur if wheat is not loaned out or procured faster.
“several months ago we cut the supply of wheat by 25 percent but we recovered soon because of the speedy procurement process but now it has slowed down and our stock is almost empty. there is only a small amount reserved for universities, defense and prisoners in jail. we are waiting for ndrmc to save us from our current problem.’’
under normal circumstances regions and administrations receive the following number of quintals of wheat per month: oromia (125,305), amhara (72,550), tigray (66,417), addis ababa (168,000). somali (21,716), afar (2,875), gambella (20,700) beneshal gamuz (20,001).
egte sells the wheat at 550 birr per quintal to the trade bureaus who in turn sells it to the flour factories and then finally to the bakeries.
last january the government canceled a 2.6 billion birr contract awarded to pakistan based shakeel & company to supply 400,000 metric tons of wheat because they didn’t provide a performance guarantee and subsequently didn’t supply the wheat.
last march, the public procurement & property disposal service, pppds, opened a tender to supply four million quintals of wheat. the tender includes 10 lots, each with 400,000 quintals. of this amount 500,000 quintals are expected to be supplied this fiscal year and the rest during the next fiscal year. currently, two million quintals of wheat on its way to the country but is facing delays at port of entry. those two million quintals were supplied by, promising international trading, (800,000 quintals) and hakan agro industry (1.2 million quintals)."
"ethiopia’s banks have reported an increasing amount of non-performing loans, capital learnt.
sources from financial firms told capital that the ratio of npls have increased, reversing the previous trend. the national bank of ethiopia (nbe) recently issued a new rule, mandating that the npl be less than five percent of the outstanding loan. however according to information capital obtained, the ratio of npls increased since the government devaluated the birr by 15 percent against major hard currencies.
according to experts it is now more common for debtors to not make their payments on time and there have been more defaults. this has occurred after the central bank issued a directive limiting banks’ outstanding loans by 16.5 percent compared with the preceding year, if the person they are loaning the money to is not engaging in an export related business. furthermore, according to sources in the financial industry, some smaller banks have already maxed out on the amount of loans they are allowed to disburse.
“if a debtor knows they are not going to be able to get a new loan until next year they are less likely to use the money they earn to pay off their loan,” experts explained.
sources at the financial firms, including higher officials agreed that this is occurring in private banks, although they declined to give more details.
“even though there is a five percent limit on npls before this trend started in most banks you would only see three percent of npls, an expert in the financial sector said. he explained that the current condition may affect the youngest banks. larger banks have more capital, allowing them to follow the national bank’s 16.5 percent directive.
the private sector has claimed that the new law hinders it from obtaining adequate loans while they are also facing a shortage of hard currency."
local elections postponed to next year.
"acidity and high salt content have damaged 43 percent of ethiopia’s farmland, according to a paper presented last week in adama. it says 11 million hectares of it is considered to have a high salt content.
poor irrigation and lack of awareness about using water and soil productively are two of the culprits, according to the paper.
according to the agriculture transformation agency (ata) the decline in soil fertility costs ethiopia billions of birr in reduced wheat, barley, sorghum and maize yields. the impact of soil acidity on wheat and barley production alone is estimated to cost the country over 18 billion birr per year.
one thing that would really help reduce acidity is treating the soil with limes. several researchers have undertaken significant multi-year studies that have varied lime application to measure the effects on productivity.  improvements ranging from 50 to 100pct in wheat, barley, teff, soybean and maize were reported under moderate to severe acidic soil conditions
according to the paper adding limes could increase cereal production to 4.6 tons per hectare from its current 1.1 tons per hectare. however, the price is daunting since treating just one hectare of land for acidity takes 2.6 tons of limes and just one quintal goes for 170 birr. primarily for this reason limes are only being used at six local farms.
“we need to work on transporting limes more efficiently,” dr. kaba urgesa, state minister for agricultural and natural resources, said
in the past six months 14,000 out of 26,000 hectares of acidic soil has been treated.
soil runoff is another concern according to a staff from ata.
“the soil in the highland areas has washed off and many important nutrients are missing so we must do something to save our soil.”
dr. kaba says the government is taking steps to alleviate the problem by importing crops from amahara, oromia, somalia and tigray.
he says fertilizer is being used on cereal crops along with potash on 49,406 hectares of soil and they have seen increased fertility.
ethiopian soils are deficient in various essential nutrients like boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, and zinc and copper, although severity differs from region to region. some nutrients like iron are in a sufficient range in many parts of the country. however, nutrient availability to crops depends on numerous soil and crop factors such as: soil ph, organic matter content, soil texture, adsorptive surface, nutrient interactions in the soil, and crop varieties."
"representatives from ethiopia’s manufacturing industry claim that a shortage of hard currency has led them to produce under their capacity which has caused a chain reaction where production costs have risen, prices have increased and the economy has slowed down.
the nation’s forex shortage over the last few years has seriously affected private sector activity.  this has not only negatively affected import businesses in all areas, but is especially true in the manufacturing sector with small scale businesses and heavy industries.
in the past, to address the problem the state owned financial giant commercial bank of ethiopia (cbe) allocated a limited amount of hard currency so the manufacturing industry could import inputs and spare parts.
last week cbe released usd 300 million to the private sector leaving investors puzzled when they learned of the amount during the latest letter of credit (lc) process. this is the first time in a year that any significant amount of hard currency had been released by cbe.
over the past several months some industries were forced to suspend production as they could not get adequate materials to manufacture their products while others were producing far less than their potential, according to people working in the industry.
“we have a company which makes construction materials but it hasn’t been able to operate as usual because we don’t have enough of the imported materials, such as chemicals, that we need,” said one investor. he claims has been forced to pay salary to his employees for over two months now without operating.
experts in the banking industry stated that the long awaited lc approval from cbe has shocked the private sector. they think that usd 300 million is a very small amount to be shared among investors who for instance manage over 3,000 employees in a single factory.
the foreign exchange application is said to be in the billions at the cbe but only usd 300 million has been offered as of last week. “the highest amount awarded per applicant is no more than 100,000 usd; many could only get as much as 30,000 to 40,000 usd for their long standing application for foreign currency,” a financial institution source added.
experts said that some of the companies need more than one billion birr in hard currency (one usd is equivalent to around 27.5 birr) for a single industry, and the current forex is allocated to the manufacturing industry only.
investors in the sector told capital that the current hard currency allocation will only allow their plants to run for not more than two weeks.
“what is happening today is  that people who rely on imports for their primary business are entering the export business simply to secure foreign currency, which they can use for their imports,” a financial sector expert said.
“this dire need has led to corruption in the banking sector because people are selling their forex for at least 5 birr per dollar in addition to the standard exchange rate. people with dollar accounts in the country are said to be selling their foreign currency just like on the black market,” he added.
investors say that the hard currency shortage is affecting the entire economic structure. “the shortage of inputs has forced us to operate under capacity which has escalated the production cost,” a manufacturing plant owner told capital.
“we are running up to ten percent of our capacity, it is better if we at least run at half of the capacity,” he added.
experts said that the current lc approval from cbe would allow factories to run from one to ten percent of their actual capacity.
“the production cost for a factory run at ten percent capacity or 100 percent is similar since it uses the same machines, manpower, energy, spare parts, bank interest and other operational expenses, that lead to high production cost when companies run under their capacity and this makes the end product very expensive,” they said.
“as a state we are losers if we do not operate our industries at least by 75 to 50 percent of their capacity,” an expert said.
producing under capacity will create high inflation. meanwhile the central bank has taken several measures to reduce the money circulation from the market. it introduced various policies and rules like the recently applied directive that forced the outstanding loan disbursement of banks to grow by only 16 percent compared with the performance a year ago.this occurred after the devaluation that the government applied on october 11 to control potential inflation that might follow the reduction of birr value by 15 percent against major hard currencies.
at the same time experts argued the devaluation is being implemented at the wrong time. “it has been applied when there are not sufficient resources or inputs for industries,” said an economist requesting anonymity. he argued that devaluation would work when there are ample inputs or resources like intermediate goods and capital goods in the country. “the manufacturing industry that engages in import substitution can cover about 60 percent from local sources because the resources from local sources are very limited. the balance of resources may still need hard currency to import,” he added.
effect on industries
“the country is experiencing a dire problem, business is really strangled,” said zafu eyesuswork zafu, founder of the united bank and the united insurance company.  but none of this is a surprise; it has been forecasted for a long time now, he said.
many businesses are now returning back their licenses, as they are not able to sustain the situation, according to the financial expert. “this situation is symptomatic of a very critical juncture in ethiopia’s foreign exchange situation,” zafu said. it is very sad and cannot continue like this. it is very concerning for the country.
experts said that the underproduction in the manufacturing sector may not only influence the market price but can also affect the country’s general economic activity.
company owners said that they are undertaking their business with a large amount of capital they have secured from financial firms. “if we cannot manage the business as per the expected capacity the effect will force us to fail to settle the huge amount of bank loans,”an expert on business administration explained.
the expert said that the supply of capital goods has been suspended in the past several months which affects the supply of intermediate goods from heavy industries for some factories, including small scale industries that use what they make as an input for their final product.
“it will hence be difficult for manufacturers to settle their debt without production,” he added. he explained that this would force banks to foreclose on the industries but they won’t get potential buyers because there will not be a capacity to buy such kind of industries and  no one will be interested since the situation would be similar for the new owners.
if banks are unable to collect loans, financial institutions could end up operating in the red. if industries that owe a lot of money to banks run under production it will transfer to an industry crisis – financial crisisand country level economic crisis  in the near future unless the government provides adequate attention and solutions for the situation,” experts said.
“besides effects on companies, the government’s tax collection would be significantly affected because most of the manufacturing industries contribute significantly to the economy,” a person who manages over ten businesses said.  “the effect is not only seen in the manufacturing sector; it has also been observed in other areas; for instance, if you see the number of companies that are not renewing their business licenses the number is not small,” he noted.
“the government has to give recognition to the private sector and facilitate conditions as one of the economic pillars for the country; the same attention that it gives industries,” a part-time management lecturer and business owner said.
recommended solutions
most experts and the private sector actors agree that the current challenge may continue at least for the coming couple of years unless the government takes immediate action.
“the situation is so bleak there doesn’t seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel,” zafu opined.
he said that the solution to start with is for the government to support the private sector development and make it a partner. “its role (private sector) is minuscule today. it needs to be supported to enter the export business,” he added.
the private sector has played a significant role in boosting the economy and creating more jobs, in this regard it shares the government’s burden.
an expert in the manufacturing sector also claimed that the public projects are taking the major portion of the regular hard currency earnings of the country. “as we understand most of the public projects are not finalized as per the schedule or with very significant delays, while they have consumed an overwhelming amount of capital resources,” the expert said.
he recommended that the government evaluate its policy on public projects and reconsider the expenditure and allocation of hard currency based on the required priority.
“it (government) could postpone some of the projects and sustain the private sector before the current hard currency problem transfers to a bigger crisis,” he recommended.
“i have always said you cannot do everything at the same time,” zafu told capital. “as the old saying goes, ‘you do not try to go up two trees because you have two legs.’”
zafu explained that the public projects have played a major role in the economic growth that the country registered in the past, but the private sector that has the capacity to contribute its part is not getting the required attention.
“state led projects such as in the energy sector contribute significantly to the country and economy but it would be difficult for the government to run all of them on its own. we believe that the government has to give a stake in the economic growth to the private sector,” he said.
experts said that the government needs a policy shift to settle challenges on hard currency earnings and disbursement. they say the recent cbe hard currency distribution is ‘peanuts’ compared to the demand.
if the government can’t postpone some of its projects it could also look at other options based on other countries’ experiences.
experts also argued that the government’s behavior of getting involved in different economic areas has to be stopped. “it has an interest to engage in all areas of investments like the assembly of electronic materials and some other sectors that only need a little effort and can be handled by small scale industry operators,” the business administration expert explained.
an economic expert gave the example of turkey. “when turkey faced a crisis in 2001 it used the resources from the international monetary fund to recover again. ethiopia should use such kind of sources instead of retreating,” he said.
the government is not afraid to negotiate about such kind of capital injection from international sources, according to experts in the manufacturing industry. “it’s all about negotiation and coming up with a better understating with international financers to use foreign money instead of getting into a crisis,” the economic expert added.
sources said that recently some international financial firms have approached the government to provide credit to alleviate the hard currency shortage but the government’s response is unknown.
most experts and business operators also place a priority on political stability. they said that the recent instability has played a crucial role in slowing down the business transactions and affecting the economy."
"a recent report from the addis ababa labor and social affairs indicates that there are over 100,000 unemployed people living in addis ababa. this is in spite of the fact that many have graduated from colleges and universities or technical and vocational schools.
sixty thousand of the unemployed are men while 43,148 women are jobless. these figures do not include people who migrate to addis looking for work.
among the ten sub-cities ledeta has the highest number of unemployed at 31,673, kolefe and yeka come in second and third at 22,342 and 19,782 people respectively. kirkos has the lowest number at 10,756.
the report says 43,148 people told the bureau they got a job recently of whom 21,117 are women. when the registration occurred around 30,000 people were unaccounted for so it is not known if they obtained employment.
recent research indicated that there is a mismatch of education and training so that many do not have the skills needed to meet the needs of the labor market. other problems include an unparalleled population growth and availability of jobs, and the high level of migration from rural to urban areas which increase the number of unemployed people in addis ababa. albeit to a lesser extent recently, recruitment culture has also its own share of the blame. employers’ tendency of ignoring young graduates and their obsession with five plus years of work experience appears for many young graduates terrifyingly intimidating. according to world bank’s africa development indicators, 81.4% of youths and 43% of adults in ethiopia worked in the informal sector of which 12.5% of the youth and 49.6% of the adults were self-employed.
according to the international labor organization (ilo) currently urban youth unemployment in ethiopia stands at an appalling 40%. terrifyingly many of these young ethiopians who are out of the job market are not only unemployed, but also unemployable due mostly to the poor level of education they have received.
last year the government approved 10 billion birr in revolving funds to curb unemployment in ethiopia but the budget faces criticism due to poor utilization.
an estimated half a million recent graduates are unemployed in ethiopia."
"private companies working in heavy industry and other major investments are asking the government to consider facilitating interest relief and settling debt extensions for loans they previously took.
heavy industry investors that capital contacted stated that for the last year they have not been able to obtain hard currency to import raw materials and spare parts for their operations which has negatively affected their production.
an investor, who on conditions of anonymity, said his company has over 2,000 employees, but their production is not as good as in the past and they have not been able to get foreign currency to import material to produce one of the major materials for the development projects in the country.
experts in the heavy industry sector claim that the scarcity of hard currency has forced the prices of some products to skyrocket.
“if you see the steel industry, which is one of the fastest growing sector by adding some local and fdi investors, is suffering from lack of foreign currency,” an expert on the steel industry said.
the sector demands significant amount of hard currency to import a portion of billet but it has never secured lc in the past year, according to a sector expert. this causes the sector actors to limit their operation.
recently it has been reported that the pharmaceutical sector is suffering from a hard currency shortage. this indicates the country is in a severe hard currency crunch, according to experts.
“such kind of light industry is not expected to lose hard currency,” an expert in the pharmaceutical sector said. he argued that the pharmaceutical industry would be satisfied with a few million usd and didn’t require more than usd 30 million.
“but the manufacturers are claiming that they are suffering from the hard currency,” he said. he added that it shows that how the country is suffering from a lack of hard currency that does not even cover the demand of light but crucial areas.
for the heavy industries that experts estimated for over 150 companies the hard currency demand would be in hundreds millions of dollars. “if you look for the major steel industry there may be 40 companies, but their hard currency demand for a single year would be in billions of dollars,
“this would not be sufficient for the factories to operate in full capacity,” an expert on the steel industry who wanted anonymity told capital.
the expert claimed that most of the steel industry is running at one third of its capacity, but recently its actual production has been significantly smashed.
the private sector also argued that even though they borrowed a huge amount of money to expand their business and manage the day to day operation the current political instability particularly in
oromia region, which is the major destination, particular the surrounding of addis ababa, for heavy industries in the country has been affected in addition to the problems they are having obtaining inputs.
in the last two years frequent boycotts and unrest has been observed in the region which they say has affected their production. “we have also observed the problem in the factory compounds,” the private sector actors engaged in heavy industry said. they claimed that they manage more than 1,000 employees, while some of them have up to 3,000 workers.
“the shortage of hard currency and the unrest has affected our revenue,” the private sector actors claimed.
they are concerned with the burden of debt. “most of every heavy industry investment has borrowed a significant amount of money for their operation,” an expert said. “it can be seen that a single company borrows hundreds of millions of birr from banks,” the expert added.
the current business slowdown has affected the debt settlement schedule for the companies, according to sources in the industry.
they want the government to reschedule the payment of their credit, otherwise it will backfire on the sector and the country’s economy, since they have a huge amount of capital and work force.
“we do not have the revenue we expected and this has directly affected our cash flow so we are unable to pay back our credit,” a heavy industry actor said.
“if the company does not have raw material it is clear that it does not have work,” a factory owner said.
peace is the country’s priority, while the rest is secondary but currently the question is that the youth and educated groups are looking for work that must be filled by the private sector, according to experts. the hard currency shortage is the challenge for the sector experts said. “the past one year is a challenging time for the private sector. at least the interest rate on loans should be minimized,” an industry actor said.
“companies secured loans and deposited the money to banks until they can get hard currency, but we are paying interest for the loans for one year without using the finance,” he said.
he insisted that the government get involved in the issue to find a solution at least to minimize the interest rate, which is currently over 19 percent on private and over 10 percent on the two state owned banks.
ethiopia has been expanding its manufacturing industry that it wants to make it the major source of the economy. according to the government policy, the heavy industry is one of the major areas that the government plans to boost in the current growth and transformation plan (gtp ii).
tadesse haile, special advisor to the prime minister in the industry sector, told capital that the issue has to be answered by national bank of ethiopia (nbe).
he said that the central bank and other private and public financial institutions are appropriate bodies to handle the case.
“the hard currency shortage is a real effect in the country, but it is natural since our development demands huge amount of foreign currency,” tadesse said.
most of the developmental projects are demanding hard currency, which is the major source of finance for projects since most of the inputs are imported, according to the pm advisor.
tadesse, who mainly follows the textile and leather sector, said that the textile and leather are also sources of hard currency generation and has to get foreign currency since they generate it.
“we are supporting these sectors to get priority from the financial institutions, while sometimes they face challenges in terms of accessing lc,” he added.
he said that the textile and leather sector hard currency demands are not considered very small. however they are not equal with the demand of heavy industries like the steel industry.
most of the inputs for the textile and leather sector are on imported items, for instance the garment sector is still mainly using import fabrics and cotton is also imported like accessories, according to haile.
he said that the steel sector is one of the major areas that support the country’s developmental projects. but he preferred to refrain from speaking further about the sector as he said there are others following it.
the manufacturing sector will grow by 24 percent in the coming years of gtp ii, while total industrial sector development is targeted to register an 18 percent growth.
the manufacturing sector has grown by 8 percent in the past five years of the gtp i, according to the national bank of ethiopia (nbe). based on the current plan, it is expected to register a threefold increase. the industrial sector share will also reach 23 percent of the gdp by 2020.
the manufacturing sector is one of the basic pillars of the economic restructuring. in the final year of the five year plan, the sector is expected to generate usd four billion from manufacturing exports.
while exports from the manufacturing sector currently accounts for only 10 percent of the total exports, it is expected to make up 25 of the total share of hard currency earnings in gtp ii. manufacturing will rise to 40 percent of total export earnings by 2025."
"between last july and this january, 137 people were killed in fires, floods or bridge slides and over 40 million birr in property was damaged. there were 188 total incidents and 80 percent of them were fires.
there has been a slight decrease in the number of fires most of which are caused by candles, electric wires, stoves and cylinders and burned 42 homes causing six million birr in damages. bole, kolfe, akaki sub cities have the most fires at 24, 18 and 13 respectively. akaki sub city suffered a 22 million birr loss in damages from fire. addis ketema sub city saw 9 accidents over the first half of the fiscal year causing 32 million birr of damage to six manufacturing companies and seven trucks.
a recent study showed that 20 places in the metro region are susceptible to flooding and relocation of homes was recommended.
many fires are caused by electrical wiring. older homes are particularly susceptible, as they were not wired for years. many homes that were built in the 50′s and 70′s have aluminum wiring that gets very hot and increases the chance of fire. heating is another major cause of residential fire accidents. this is especially true for people in the outskirts of addis ababa who use wood for cooking.
with the eight branches, the agency reaches 10 districts that cover 116 woredas. of the 463 accidents recorded in addis ababa last year, the majority, 368, were caused by fire. the agency said that an additional 125 hydrants will be installed during the 2017/18 fiscal year. currently, there are four hydrants per 10 square meters in the city.
the eighty-year-old agency is limited to eight stations, which were previously the only spots where water could be refilled by fire fighters.
there are currently 1,200 staff, 33 ambulances, three sky lift ladders and eight water trucks. the trucks have a capacity to hold 7,000 liters of water."
"the public procurement and property disposal service (pppds) announced that among the 49 private companies who agreed to supply detergent, toilet paper, tyres, toners, computers and stationary materials for federal institutions and universities have failed to live up to their end of the bargain.
at a meeting held on march7, at the ministry of finance and economy cooperation (mofec),companies who supply the product said that the recent dollar appreciation hampered their ability to supply the products at their old prices.
tesfaye birhanu pppds, procurement administration vice head said, “two years ago the companies agreed to supply the materials to the government institutions for a three year period and now they are asking us for more money. we have sent their request to mofec but they want the materials sent at the original price.”
he added that low quality products also pose a problem.
“like those who mix teff flour with sawdust, some suppliers provided faulty products and we need to expose this practice,” he said.
tesfaye also feels more local products should be procured.
“toilet paper, soap, other little things are still imported and sold to government entities and many of the local factories don’t have the capacity to produce and supply the materials, we need to change our system and stop working like this and scale up local companies so they can supply these items to universities and other government institutions.”
in other news pppds announced that belay belayab motors plc won the tender to supply 400 vehicles to government official sat 352 million birr.
in this fiscal year pppds plan to procure 7.4 billion birr worth of different materials for universities."

the number of displaced persons from ethiopia has increased to 9,667, as of friday march 16, according to a statement by the kenyan red cross. the statement said that more and more people are continuing to cross the ethiopia and kenya border to seek refuge in moyale, marsabit county.
people started fleeing and crossing the border into kenya after members of the ethiopian army shot to death at least nine civilians in moyale town. more than fifteen people were also wounded during the incident.
according to the kenyan red cross, the displaced persons are currently concentrated in different areas in kenya: sessi (3,080 people), sololo (2,792 people), somare (1,830 people), cifa/butiye (890 people), dambala fachana (1,075 people) while others have integrated with the host community.
“a makeshift camp has been established at dambala fachana in sololo to provide shelter for populations that were previously residing at maeyi, kukub, gada korma and dambala fachana in sololo ward. efforts to set up transitional shelters and finalize on the camp set up are also ongoing,” the statement read.
it is also stated that mass nutrition screening is currently ongoing to establish the nutritional status of children under five years, pregnant and lactating women. the prevailing situation in the makeshift camps continues to be of concern as the children may be susceptible to infections, especially with the onset of rains, which may lead to a decline in their nutritional status.
“the main ailments so far treated at the out-patient department clinics during the medical outreaches are diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, eye infections and skin infections,” the statement reads.
the integrated medical outreaches have been conducted in collaboration with the ministry of health (moh)–kenya, kenya red cross society, concern worldwide and beyond zero initiative.
“the kenya red cross society has been conducting multiple interventions since this crisis broke out. today, we have led a high delegation to moyale with key partners and decision makers for them to witness firsthand the critical needs of these families. we really hope for a sustainable solution,” said dr. abbas gullet, secretary general of kenya red cross, in a press release sent out on friday, march 16, 2018.
the statement also said that the kenya red cross society continues to provide the much-needed humanitarian support especially through food and non-food items, integrated medical outreaches, health education and sanitation. the county government has also been on site providing food and water to the refugees with support from well-wishers."
"a new 127 page environmental analysis conducted by the world bank and environment and climate research center showed that inadequate land management processes, lack of coordination between urban and transport planners are key institutional challenges for ethiopian’s growing urban centers.
the study which took three years to complete also indicates that the current rigid land tenure system which does not allow land holders to sell or mortgage lands causes them to stay on the land instead of moving to the cities even when they might benefit economically.
these issues also cause municipalities to have inadequate revenue to cover all investment needs for water supply, sanitation service and transport systems.
according to the study despite improvements, supply of power and connectivity of transportation are insufficient to attract or promote industrial investments and enhance productivity  and as well lack of capability of micro and small enterprise to invest in environmental friendly initiatives
the analysis showed very little is known about the potential areas of ground water resources. costs and benefits of various uses of resources are incomplete which include inputs and outputs of agriculture, forestry, and biofuel production. information about environmental effects (land degradation, deforestation, and loss of eco system services are also incomplete. upstream farmers do not have sufficient incentives to undertake tree planting, landscape rehabilitation, and soil and water conservation to reduce run-off and siltation of dams downstream.
according to the research more than half of all croplands still need conservation measures and billons of ethiopian birr are needed to invest in soil and water conservation structures to conserve sloping croplands and to bring degraded land back into production for a growing population.
the paper study which looked at the policy and intuitional framework of environmental management finds that some laws lack implementing regulations and standards, which presents an opportunity for updating and up grading to address key issues. beyond the laws and the rules, environmental management faces challenges of coordination and communication across sector and ministers both at federal and regional state levels.
it further elaborated that although local communities can play a pivotal role in environmental management, they are not regularly and actively engaged in decision- making process due to lack of priority, mandate or funds at the decentralized government level. the enforcement of existing environmental policies is not well- coordinated among responsible ministries and regional local bodies.
the study depicted that energy market distortions undermine sustainable energy production. analysis of willingness to pay is needed to understand the constraints for consumers, and the benefit of both grid and off- grid technology options."
"the house of people’s representatives endorsed the state of emergency proclamation, despite a significant number of votes against the measure. during the extraordinary session on march 2, house speaker abadula gemeda chaired the session.
the state of emergency, which has been in effect since it was endorsed by the council of ministers in mid-february, was first approved with 346 votes for 88 against and seven abstentions. later the number was corrected to 395 votes
there were fears that the proclamation would be refuted by the representatives. when the speaker announced that the law was approved by a majority vote, it was accompanied by heavy applause from those who supported the endorsement.
opposition leaders, especially those in the diaspora were advocating for the parliament to vote against the state of emergency. according to the speaker, because there were 8 of the 547 members not present 339 votes were needed for a two-thirds majority. there were concerns raised that 98 votes were of the 539 potential votes were unaccounted for. only 441 votes were recorded during the session at first. however this number has also raised to 490 later.
this was confusing because most of the members attended the session. the outgoing pm and the potential future pm from opdo did not attend but there were very few others who were absent, according to observers.
before the parliament went to vote several questions and opinions on the proclamation were debated by members. one parliament member asked if the state of emergency period could be reduced to three months rather than six , but attorney general getachew ambaye did not address that question..
the state of emergency proclamation suspended the practice of most of basic rights like peaceful demonstrations. another member raised the issue of the upcoming local elections in may. the parliamentarian felt that this would limit the amount of campaigning people could engage in.
getachew agreed that the state of emergency would affect the city elections but said it was crucial to bring peace to the country. he added that they would address the issue later.
a week ago workneh gebeyehu (phd), minister of foreign affairs, hinted that the martial law would be lifted when the new pm was elected.
a parliament board to oversee the emergency measures was also criticized by some of the members, but approved by majority vote, with nine against and 24 abstentions.
most of the members served during the previous state of emergency period which ended last august. tadess hordofa, was tapped as chairman of the parliamentary board formed to oversee the emergency measures.
many western nations have expressed concern about the state of emergency."
"transition going smoothly gov’t saysduring a meeting with the diplomatic community last week, the ethiopian government hinted that the state of emergency may not last long and could be repealed after the new prime minister comes to power, capital learnt from diplomatic sources.
the meeting held on tuesday february 20 between the diplomatic community and diplomats sent to ethiopia from other countries, mainly focused on state of emergency and recent resignation of the prime minister.
the diplomatic community raised some questions and concerns about the situation in the country in a closed door session, according to sources.
in his initial speech workneh gebeyehu, minister of foreign affairs, told the diplomatic community that the transition is going smoothly and the country is becoming stable. according to diplomatic sources, in the closed session the chief diplomat of ethiopia said that the state of emergency many not last long. this week many of ethiopia’s allies made statements criticizing the state of emergency.
in the discussion of the diplomats from a country that has a strong partnership with ethiopia claimed that frequently imposing a state of emergency can affect the country’s image and cause foreign investors to loose trust. in addition to concerning those who have already invested, it can prevent people who were planning on coming from doing so, according to sources.
workneh said that the state of emergency may not last long. “he said that ‘the new pm can act upon it’,” sources said.
he also stated that some of the embassies expressed their concern about the state of emergency but he insisted that it would be best to talk to his government and him before acting.
he also asked the diplomatic community for positive assistance during this time that he called ‘in this critical condition for the country’, sources said.
as of friday february 16 the executive body implemented a state of emergency for six months. the parliament is expected to amend it when they return from break this week.
immediately after the decree several government partners like the us, eu, germany and the uk issued unusual statements criticizing the state of emergency."
"the highly anticipated congress of the ethiopian people’s revolutionary democratic front (eprdf) is pushed for unspecified period, capital learnt.
it is not disclosed why the meeting is postponed. however in the coming week the 180 member council of the ruling party is expected to meet in addis ababa. according to the information capital obtained, the meeting is expected to focus on the assignment of the new party chairperson, who shall be the upcoming pm.
the ruling party regularly held its congress every two years in the past three decades. however the latest congress that was expected to be held in the coming month in hawassa, 275km south of addis ababa, has been postponed again for unspecified period. it was initially planned to be held in september 2017 but was postponed to march 2018.
sources told capital that there is no preparation being done for the congress that is considered as a crucial event for the ruling front that set its policy and strategy besides electing executive committee, chair and deputy chair.
according to the rule of the party the congress has to be held at least every two and half years.
in the past couple of years the country’s political arena is registering significant and historical changes besides instability for the past two year.
a week ago the party chairman and prime minister hailemariam desalegn announced his resignation from both positions, while state of emergency has been placed a day after the pm announcement.
the release of several prominent political leaders and activists also happened in the past weeks.
the upcoming congress of the ruling party has been highly expected since rumors that indicated there is division with the party climbing. after the pm resignation the expectation for the congress has been heated."
"pm hailemariam desalegn who served as prime minister for over five years unexpectedly announced his resignation to be ‘part of the solution’ for the current crisis in the country.
over the last few years political instability has occurred in two major regions. the government declared a state of emergency in october 2016 that lasted ten months. the situation appeared to be calm for a while. however protests and violence continued to rock the country.
the major problem since the beginning of the ethiopian new year has been the conflict between the ethiopia somali special forces along the border area of the oromia region, the biggest ethnic group in the country followed by revolts in some parts of oromia. there have also been smaller protests in other parts of the country.
the outgoing pm submitted his resignation to the southern ethiopia peoples’ democratic movement (sepdm), a party that included different ethnic groups in the southern region, on wednesday february 15. in his announcement on thursday afternoon hailemariam said that his resignation has been accepted by the executive committees of his party and the coalition front eprdf.
“the main reason i have submitted my resignation is because i hold the firm belief that it was necessary for me to tender it as part of a solution aimed at ensuring lasting peace and guaranteeing democracy in our country going forward,” he said during his seven minute statement. he added that he was resigning because the many questions and grievances that have been raised by the public require and demand answers.“going forward, once the peaceful transition of power receives a final endorsement by the house of peoples representatives, i will provide a further statement on that occasion,” he said.
recently the four party leaders of eprdf talked about reforms that included releasing political prisoners. at the same time the protests occurred in the oromia region that forced the government to release more political prisoners, including merera gudina (phd) and some other opposition political figures a few weeks ago.
“on my part, in an effort to fulfill my responsibilities as a party to these reforms, i have officially tendered, of my own volition, my resignation from the leadership of both the eprdf and the government,” the outgoing pm said.
hailemariam’s resignation occurs immediately after the protests and instability in oromia followed by the release of another group of oromo opposition members and journalists and other opposition figures.
the resignation of the pm is expected to be ratified by the parliament. he said he would continue in his role until he is replaced.
“the situation of our country currently is a cause for concern but in order to alleviate these concerns, i call on the public-at-large to maintain the togetherness of our society as has been practiced across generations and to continue to play their part in the development of our country,” hailemariam said to the public during his speech.
a day after the pm announced his resignation, the council of ministers held a meeting that took them over six hours to discuss the implementation of the state of emergency. journalists filled the pm’s office to attend a press briefing scheduled for that afternoon but the meeting went on into the evening hours and the press briefing was canceled. that night several reports circulated online and on local media indicating that some prominent opposition figures from amhara were freed from prison."
"siraj rules out transitional governmentminister of defence siraj fegessa said during a press conference held at defence force club on saturday february 17, that there would be no transitional government or military takeover because the current government was democratically elected. some analysts entertained this idea to alleviate concerns after several significant events including thursday’s surprise resignation of prime minister hailemariam desalegn led to the announcement on state media friday of a new state of emergency.
siraj fegessa said protests and group gatherings are banned and that security fources would be instructed to take action against people disturbing the peace. a special court has been set up to prosecute people who incite violence as well.
the parliment is expected to approve the state of emergency within 15 days.
some political commentators have recommended a national reconciliation committee, the formation of a commission, fresh elections and improving human rights in order to foster a more open political climate in the country.
in a recent statement the ruling coalition eprdf stated that it would apply moves to improve the political situation. political prisoners were freed including many last week which led to celebrations among protests.
siraj was expected to provide details about the state of emergency in the press conference, however, he failed to provide specifics only stating it would be six months with an option to extend another four months, a tribunal would be set up and that protests and group gatherings were banned. internet shutdowns were also discussed as an option if the situation worsened. the previous state of emergency lasted for ten months, ending in august 2017.
a statement that circulated via state media said more details would come via relevant security heads.
siraj said that violent gestures (protest gestures) were not allowed, public violence, civil demonstrations and group gatherings were banned.
ethiopia’s council of ministers on friday cited deaths, ethnic attacks and mass displacement as reasons for the latest state of emergency. the announcement followed protests in towns across the oromia region on monday and tuesday that called for reforms and tension along the oromia somali border.
similar protests have taken place across ethiopia since 2015, leading the government to declare a state of emergency in october 2016 after hundreds of people if not thousands were reportedly killed."
"the state owned commercial bank of ethiopia targeted to earn 8.8 billion birr profit by the middle of this fiscal year. however, they are far behind that goal because hard currency earnings have been lagging. this is largely due to the recent devaluation of the birr and poor export earnings.
according to data that capital obtained, 3.67 billion birr was earned during this time and hard currency exchange was 28 percent of that amount.
sources at the bank told capital that the recent birr devaluation led to a one hundred million birr loss.
“the lc which was open before october for exporters cost us four birr per dollar because they bought the dollar from us at 23 birr but the devaluation caused the dollar to be sold at 27 birr. the other reason is our bank has not been earning a large amount of money from exports, previously over 60 percent of exports passed through our bank but now it is less than 30 percent,’’ the source said.
capital tried to reach cbe’s communication officer but to no avail.
“savings and collections from loans are going well in a majority of our branches which is positive news for the bank and as you know the some of the profit goes to the government for development so if we don’t make a lot of profit it affects development.’’
the source also added that the national bank of ethiopia rejected cbe’s plan to allow its customers to use 40 percent of their export earnings to import unrelated items from the export work they do in order to earn dollars.
nbe redirected cbe to follow the old plan that required customers to fully use their export earnings on importing items related to their work in order to receive hard currency.
with the current procedures imported items that are paid for with hard currency and pass through cbe get a commission of 1.5 percent and the national bank of ethiopia also obtains the same percentage.
in the last fiscal year cbe earned close to 32 billion birr in revenue. of which the gross profit before tax is 14.6 billion birr. the bank has collected usd 4.5 billion via remittances export trade and other businesses."
"sugar prices and shortages still sour ethiopia’s urban markets; but the sugar corporation, the sole manufacturer and importer says it is supplying enough volume.
the price escalation and shortage of the sweet has dogged the country for the past several decades as production and imports have failed to meet up with the growing demand and since the beginning of the ethiopian new year it has become one of the nation’s major issues.
even though the problem has not gone away industries that use sugar as an ingredient in their products say they are getting enough to continue production. gashaw aycheluhem, public relations head of the sugar corporation, told capital that most of the sugar factories are undertaking production as expected while others just started recently.
he said that metehara, wonji, kesem and fincha factories are actively operating, while kuraz 2 and arjo dedessa are the others which recently commenced production after the heavy rain that halted their production in the past few months.
“kuraz 2 which began a trial test in march last year stopped production for six months because the rain affected the sugar cane collection process but since the end of last december the factory has commenced production,” he explained.
he said that arjo dedessa also started production, but he declined to give a specific daily production volume.
he also stated that the recently procured one million tons of sugar was imported by four different consignment periods.
“the first batch is 250,000 quintals and is already being transported from the port at djibouti,” he said.
he said that every month the corporation is delivering up to 600,000 quintals of sugar for three different potential end users; regional customers, consumer associations in addis ababa and the manufacturing industry. these are the three end sugar users according to the sugar corporation. gashaw stated that the sugar corporation is delivering the sweetener, but it is still scarce for industries and consumers.
a representative of a candy manufacturer who did not want to be mentioned told capital that for the last several months his company is getting half of the usual quota that it secured before. he also stated that the limited supply has affected their production.
getachew birbo, head of moha soft drink, told capital that in the past year and a half the supply of sugar has been relatively better than the preceding period. he said that their monthly demand is 3,000 quintals, but currently they are getting 2,200 quintals per month.
gashaw thinks that the current shortage of their soft drinks is related to distribution methods by consumer associations or regional offices. “distribution is the responsibility of other relevant bodies,” he said.
currently the price of sugar is over 40 birr per kg if it is available in the market. the stated price is about three times the original price.
consumers and some service sector professionals are complaining about the shortage. some in the service sector including big hotels and cafes say they are unable to serve hot drinks due to lack of sugar. customers stated that it is common to see a sugar shortage in cafes.
according to users the price of soft drinks at retail markets has also increased. shop owners say this is because of the soaring price of sugar. however, manufacturers have denied there is an increase. according to the sugar corp public relations head, the sugar factories metehara, wonji, fincha, kesem, arjo, tendaho and kuraz 2 have a sugarcane crushing capacity of 5,000, 6,250, 12,000, 6,000, 8,000, 13,000 and 12,000 tons per day respectively. but this does not indicate the current actual production, only their capacity.
even though the government had plans to construct and commence production of ten new sugar factories during the first gtp (2010-2015), almost all of its projections failed.
in the past year tendaho and kesem that commenced over a decade ago and kuraz 2, which was constructed by the chinese company have been finished.
most of the others were managed by metec a state industry developer. some of these have been delayed of have performed weakly. the government has stated that sugar would be a major source of hard currency, but that has failed to materialize."
prime minister hailemariam dessalegn has submitted his resignation. his resignation is accepted by his party eprdf. he said that the country is in a crossroads.
"two ethiopians considered by rights groups as among the country’s most prominent political prisoners are to be released as part of the government’s efforts to “foster national reconciliation” after almost three years of anti-regime protests. andualem aragie, vice president of the unity for democracy and justice party and jailed for treason, and eskinder nega, a journalist who has been detained seven times on treason and terrorism charges, are in a group of 746 people serving sentences for terrorism, inciting violence and similar offences to be freed, the state-affiliated fana broadcasting corporation reported on thursday.
the announcement follows the release of almost 6,400 prisoners and detainees last month. they are the first steps in what the ethiopian people’s revolutionary democratic front, which has ruled since 1991, has said will be an opening up of the “democratic landscape”. analysts say the moves are tacit recognition that repression has failed to quell almost three years of protests by people across large swaths of the country, and particularly in the oromia and amhara regions, demanding greater democracy. andualem was one of the cofounders of the udj in 2009, having already served several years in prison for opposing the government. he was detained again in september 2011 and sentenced to life imprisonment in june 2012 for “attempting to dismantle the constitution”, according to the charges. eskinder was first arrested on treason charges in 2005 when he was editor of the newspaper satenaw over demonstrations against the result of the 2005 general election. he was pardoned at the end of 2007 but the newspaper closed. he was arrested in september 2011 on anti-terrorism charges and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment in january 2012. the following year a un panel concluded that eskinder’s imprisonment was “a result of his peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression”.
commenting on the news that journalist and amnesty international prisoner of conscience eskinder nega will be among 746 prisoners released as part of a government pardon, sarah jackson, amnesty international’s deputy regional director for east africa, the horn and the great lakes, said“it is wonderful news that this brave journalist will soon walk to freedom after seven years spent in jail simply for doing his job. he should not have spent a single day behind bars.”
“but the world must not lose sight of the thousands of other people still languishing in jail on trumped up and politically-motivated terrorism charges, including bekele gerba, addisu bulala, woubshet taye. all prisoners of conscience must be released immediately and unconditionally and compensated for the grave injustices done to them.”

"as much as 140 gram from one kilo taken off a recent study from the trade competition and consumer protection authority (tccpa) indicates that some butchers are using fake scales to cheat customers by as much as 140 grams of meat when they purchase a kilogram.
the study, which focused on meat and retail commodities showed that many of the scales used in ethiopia are substandard regardless if they are digital or analog, meaning that consumers often end up getting the short end of the stick when it comes to purchasing meat.
of the 12 consumer associations 83 percent of butchers who sell a kilo of meat for 80 birr deduct from 10 to 143 grams from a kilo of meat, which means consumers loose more than 2,000 birr per 100kg meat.
the study also looked 21 private butchers who sell a kilo of meat for 160 birr or above and found that 64 percent of them cheated customers 130 grams per kilo of meat because they used bad scales.
according to the study conducted on 76 retailers who sold sugar, salt, coffee, wheat, white flour, and lentils from 5 to 15 grams is deducted by incorrect measuring scales.
the fake weighing machines are manufactured using cast-iron instead of aluminum and are being used by the traders to cheat the unsuspecting customers.
many complain that they are being taken advantage of by sellers and the authority is blaming the addis ababa trade bureau for not taking action.
“even though our sample size is small it does indicate that fake weighing machines are commonly being used. this is disturbing both because the consumers are being cheated and because the trade bureau is not working to eliminate these scales from the market by prosecuting those that use unregistered or un-calibrated scales. consumers need to examine the scales before using them, they should count the lines and make sure they are not being ripped off,” mengistu mola, research director at tccpa said.
the addis ababa butchers association says the study is not valid because it only covers 33 businesses out of 3,000 butcheries in the city. they argue further evaluation is needed.
the government plans to increase penalties for using fake scales."
"members of parliament are insisting that officials from the ethiopian revenue and customs authority (erca) make the list of people involved in the contraband business public. however, no response to the request was given. on tuesday january 30 during the regular session the authority appeared with its representatives to deliver their first half year performance report. moges balcha, director general of erca, talked about what they have been doing to collect more taxes and clamp down on tax cheats.
he pointed to the national contraband trade controlling command post formed to battle contraband.he said that in the first six months of the budget year 331.6 million birr of smuggled goods were seized. however, this is a 10.5 percent reduction from the preceding year.they also confiscated 105 million birr worth of goods that people were trying to smuggle out of ethiopia illegally, an increase of 121 percent from the same period last year.
a week ago in its report the ministry of trade announcedthat even though the national command post stretching from the federal to the kebele level was established, illegal border trade still continues to be a major challenge and hinders the country’s hard currency earnings.
many members of parliament remained concerned about contraband trade.
“we have heard several times about contraband at the sessions at the parliament we want to know how these people are engaged in the business and what actions you took to stop them,” one of the parliament members asked the executives of erca.
meanwhile the people’s representatives were eager to know about those that they called contrabandists but the executives of erca retreated. “it will be disclosed when the time comes,” erca officials said.
moges reported that in the last fiscal year there were 19,557 corporate business income tax payers. however, only 65.4 percent ended up paying taxes. the rest either reported a loss or no income.
in the first six months of this fiscal year there were 18,178 vat registered businesses. of those only 32 percent ended up paying taxes, while 42.8 percent reported they were owed a refund and 25 percent said they owed no taxes or qualified for a refund.
“the customs area is also the same based on a random study, only 80 percent of the imported items came under invoice,” he said.
moges said that the culture poses a very big problem because paying tax is not valued. ethiopia is one of the countries with the lowest tax collection compared with its gdp.
currently, erca has a system to review those who reported nil or a refund on their monthly vat report and has identified that most made false statements, according to the director’s report.
during the first half of the budget year erca had the goal of collecting 109.4 billion birr but it collected 83 percent of that amount, or 91 billion birr. the achievement is an increase of over 12 percent compared with the same period last year."
"according to the wjp rule of law index, released by the world justice project (wjp), ethiopia places 16th from 18 countries in the sub-saharan africa region and 10th out of 12 low income countries. the index puts ethiopia’s world raking at 107 from 113 countries.
countries measured in the sub-saharan africa region are botswana, burkina faso, cameroon, cote d’ivoire, ethiopia, ghana, kenya, liberia, madagascar, malawi, nigeria, senegal, sierra leone, south africa, tanzania, uganda, zambia, zimbabwe
countries that are measured as low-income countries are afghanistan, burkina faso, ethiopia, liberia, madagascar, malawi, nepal, senegal, sierra leone, tanzania, uganda, zimbabwe
the index measures adherence to the rule of law in 113 countries worldwide based on more than 110,000 households and 3,000 expert surveys. featuring primary data, the wjp rule of law index measures countries’ rule of law performance across eight factors: constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, open government, fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice, and criminal justice; ethiopia’s ranking in all eight factors is low.
the top three overall performers in the 2017-2018 wjp rule of law index were denmark, norway, and finland consecutively; the bottom three were afghanistan, cambodia, and venezuela, consecutively.
findings of the report shows that majority of countries worldwide saw their scores decline since the publication of the last wjp rule of law index in october 2016 in the areas of human rights, checks on government powers, and civil and criminal justice.
regionally, sub-saharan africa’s top performer is ghana, supplanting south africa from 2016 and taking 43rd place globally. burkina faso and kenya saw the biggest improvement in rank among the 18 countries indexed in the region, climbing 9 and 5 spots respectively in the global rankings.
madagascar experienced the biggest decline in rank, dropping eight spots. overall, the region showed the most improvements in absence of corruption, with four countries experiencing upward trends in this category and none showing downward trends.
“effective rule of law is the foundation for communities of equity, opportunity, and peace. no country has achieved a perfect realization of the rule of law. the wjp rule of law index is intended to be a first step in setting benchmarks, informing reforms, stimulating programs, and deepening appreciation and understanding for the foundational importance of the rule of law,” according to william h. neukom, wjp founder and ceo."
"eighty two percent of the wealth generated last year went to the richest one percent of the global population, while the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world saw no increase in their wealth, a new oxfam report states.
the report was launched as high level political and business figures gathered at davos, switzerland for the world economic forum.
the report entitled “reward work, not wealth” shows how the global economy enables the wealthy elite to accumulate vast fortunes while hundreds of millions of people are struggling to survive on poverty pay.
billionaire wealth has risen by an annual average of 13 percent since 2010 – six times faster than the wages of ordinary workers, which have risen by a yearly average of just two percent. the number of billionaires rose at an unprecedented rate of one every two days between march 2016 and march 2017.
according to winnie byanyima, executive director of oxfam international, the billionaire boom is not a sign of a thriving economy. “it is a symptom of a failing economic system. the people who make our clothes, assemble our phones and grow our food are being exploited to ensure a steady supply of cheap goods, and swell the profits of corporations and billionaire investors,” she said.
the report outlines the key factors driving up rewards for shareholders and corporate bosses at the expense of workers’ pay and conditions. these include the erosion of workers’ rights; the excessive influence of big business over government policy-making; and the relentless corporate drive to minimize costs in order to maximize returns to shareholders.
data shows that it would cost usd 2.2 billion a year to increase the wages of all 2.5 million vietnamese garment workers to a living wage. this is about a third of the amount paid out to wealthy shareholders by the top 5 companies in the garment sector in 2016.
women workers often find themselves at the bottom of the heap. across the world, women consistently earn less than men and are usually in the lowest paid and least secure forms of work. by comparison, 9 out of 10 billionaires are men.
“oxfam has spoken to women across the world whose lives are blighted by inequality. women in vietnamese garment factories who work far from home for poverty pay and don’t get to see their children for months at a time. women working in the us poultry industry who are forced to wear nappies because they are denied toilet breaks,” said byanyima.
the report advices that governments ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share of tax through higher taxes and a crackdown on tax avoidance, and increase spending on public services such as healthcare and education. oxfam estimates a global tax of 1.5 percent on billionaires’ wealth could pay for every child to go to school.
results of a new global survey commissioned by oxfam, demonstrates a groundswell of support for action on inequality. of the 70,000 people surveyed in 10 countries, nearly two-thirds of all respondents think the gap between the rich and the poor needs to be urgently addressed."
"contraband trade is negatively impacting ethiopia’s hard currency earnings. to combat this the government has formed a contraband trade controlling command post stretching from the federal to the kebele level. political instability has also reduced hard currency earnings.
the export earnings of the first half of the 2017/18 budget year indicated that the contraband of major export items significantly contributed to the lower performance.
according to wondimu filate, public relations head of the ministry of trade (mot), contraband trading of major commodities like gold, coffee and livestock continues to be a major factor in the low performance.
he pointed to the lack of coordination between federal and regional governments to cut contraband trading, particularly for livestock, as a major hindrance to solving the problem. “lack of cooperation of stakeholders has affected the hard currency earnings from gold,” wondimu added.
in the stated period the government expected usd 2.2 billion, but the actual performance was usd 1.23 billion. this is 61 percent of the projection. it is an increase of 9 percent compared with a similar period a year ago. agriculture is on the top, earning over one billion usd, while the manufacturing industry is second, generating usd 224 million.
coffee has contributed to nearly one fourth of the hard currency earnings by usd 381 million and oil seeds has amassed usd 215 million.
the mining sector has suffered. the mot report indicated that the country’s hard currency earnings from mining declined to usd 58 million from usd 107 million a year ago. for the stated six months the ministry is projected to secure usd 323 million from the mining sector and the gold sub sector was expected to generate usd 301 million.
according to the report from the total earnings of usd 58.3 million gold revenue was usd 47 million, which is almost over six times lower than the target.
wondimu claimed that the gold sector still suffers from illegal actors and stakeholders have to work strongly to combat the problem.
political unrest
wondimu added that the instability in the eastern part of the country has negatively contributed to hard currency earnings.
“the eastern part of the country, which is the major export outlet, has been affected greatly by the instability which has harmed export earnings,” he explained.
in addition, one of the country’s major hard currency sources, khat, has been suspended from export for several weeks in somaliland and a few days in djibouti.
this has decreased khat earnings, he explained.
for the year the country was expected to earn usd 167 million from khat but the actual achievement was usd 125 million. at the same time the export value and volume of the stimulant plant has declined compared with the similar period the preceding year. the mot report indicated that khat export for the first six months of 2016/17 was over 25,644 tons with a revenue of usd 143 million, but during the first six months of the current budget year it went down to 22,386tons. .
destination
in the first six months of the budget year ethiopia exported products to 137 countries. china replaced somalia, which imports a large amount of khat and vegetables, as the top destination. ethiopia exported usd 144.4 million worth of commodities to china or 10.7 percent of its total exports, while revenue from somalia brought in usd 119 million. the us has risen from 7th to 3rd place at usd 99.5 million. the us is a country ethiopia has sought to tap but has experienced difficulty doing so in the past.
the top ten export destinations make up 62.2 percent of the country’s hard currency earnings. besides china and usa several countries switched places. the export rankings of the uae, israel, belgium, and italy went up while somalia and saudi, which were first and third went down to second and fourth respectively, the netherlands, djibouti, vietnam, switzerland, uk and turkey also went down from their previous positions.
asia is the continent ethiopia exports the most to, followed by europe and africa, at 42 percent, 28 percent and 21 percent respectively."
"hotel rates in addis ababa have been dropping at an alarming rate. this is especially true of hotels away from the major business and entertainment centers of bole and kasanchies which are close to organizations like the eca, un and the bole international airport.
hotels are still doing well during peak times like when the au summit occurs and during holidays like meskel and epihany. during the month of january, when the au hosts its bi-annual summit for heads of state, they city becomes crowded with aid workers, diplomats, lobbyists, and journalists. then hotels fill up and many conference participants are forced to stay at expensive lodges and resorts outside the city but when they leave, many hotels empty out again.
in the past this was not as much of a problem due to the limited supply but when the many new hotels were built the competition became fierce. some have around a 70 percent occupancy rate but others are below 40 percent.
now some hotels switch on the room lights even though the room is empty just so people will think they have customers and the hotel is popular.
in the past five years, on average one hotel has been built every month. twenty years ago there were less than 10 standard hotels. now there are over 140 hotels and many more international and brand hotels in the pipeline.
according to data from the ministry of culture and tourism (mot)886,000 tourists came to ethiopia and stayed an average of 16 days. they spent, on average usd 234. however, some do not agree with the data. they say that if the figure was correct the occupancy rate would not have been this low.
zelalam is a tour operator who does not believe the data from mot.
“if the figures are true then one hotel should have over 6,000 customers per year but this is not the case. one thing that people might not realize is that if someone from the diaspora comes from another country to ethiopia they are registered as a tourist but they frequently stay with their family and relatives and spend nothing in the hotels.”
he feels there needs to be more attractions built in addis to lure tourists. “when a tourist comes to addis we send them to see the national museum of addis ababa, the menelik palace in entoto and take a half day tour of the city by car and at night go to traditional restaurants. the next day they travel to other parts of the country to look at different historical sites and natural attractions. from my experience tourists do not stay in adds for more than one or two days because there is not enough to keep them occupied.
“we need more recreational centers and other historical houses and places to attract tourists. this will cause people to stay in hotels longer,” he said.
price is another factor, in paris you can get a good hotel room for usd 30 but in addis they are very expensive. some charge up to usd 120. there are some, which may be a little more reasonable, they charge usd 40.
he feels the price must be fairer so tourists feel like they are getting a better value. when the price is very high they won’t stay in the hotel as long.
“we do need more rooms but they need to be quality rooms and have better accommodation facilities. he says that in the future hotels need to do more product development and give better deals when there is a low season. this will enable ethiopians to stay in hotels because most foreigners visit during high seasons,” he said.
gezagahn abate, who handles public relations for mot argues that the main reason tourists do not stay in addis longer is because tour operators do not incorporate addis ababa in their tour package.
“there is not a problem with the data. ethiopian airlines has a system to determine the reason someone comes here. they list questions asking if a person is visiting, or coming for a meeting or coming for another purpose. what we observe is tourist operators sending tourists to other regions of the country without staying a night in addis ababa which negatively affects the hotel’s income. however, i strongly believe that we have more work to do to modernize our infrastructure and hotel standards to attract more visitors.”
“it used to be that opening a hotel was easy all you needed to do was open a building. recently we applieda star rating so hotels would be judged by international standards and work harder to make their rooms cleaner and develop food and beverages that were up to standards and provide excellent customer service. i believe that the more we work on standards, the more we will satisfy visitors and therefore attract more tourists,” he said.
kumneger teketel works as a hotel consultant. he argues that occupancy rates will remain low unless more is done to attract more meetings to ethiopia.
companies often give their conference participants a budget that covers their hotel accommodations and a per diem which frees them up to spend more money where the meeting is hosted.
“data from the last five years indicates that only eight percent of tourists come to ethiopia for meetings. you can see how the hotels are full when there is big meeting in the au or un but sadly there is not an organization in ethiopia which works to attract big meetings that instead are held inafrica or across the globe. we must have a national convention center. to do this task like in kenya or south africa. we need to host big international exhibitions in many sectors that can attract a lot of participants so that our hotels can increase their market,” kumneger said.
the recent political unrest which has slightly decreased the numbers of tourists, and the expensive price of hotels are also major reasons for the local occupancy rates.
last year the addis ababa hotel owners association wrote a letter to the prime minister’s office and the ministry of culture and tourism asking that all hotels in addis be exempt from profit tax and loan interest. they argued that protests caused low occupancy rates and reduced income.
wegene alemayhu, a marketing manager at inter continental addis hotel says attracting local customers is another option to increase the occupancy rates.
“i have seen that hotels concentrate more on their room market, but they should work to have more meetings in their halls and more people in their restaurants by offering customersan affordable price. the perception of local people about hotel prices and value needs to change to attract more local people to hotels,” he said.
“honestly speaking the food in some restaurants is more expensive than the hotel but many people do not know that. though it is gradually changing some may people think that room and foodprice of the hotel is not affordable for them but there are many hotels who can serve them with a fair price and the hotel should promote themselves to stop this incorrect perception,” he further stated.
the ministry of culture and tourism has a vision to make ethiopia one of the top five tourist destinations by 2020. yohannes tilahun head of the ethiopian tourism organization (eto),says increasing hotel occupancy rates is not a one person task.
‘’we must create more infrastructure, we must host big events with thousands of participants and we are working to set up a convention center, we must upgrade our hotels interims of quality and quantity so they can serve many people, we need tour services. accomplishing this is a hard job that we are now working on and ultimately we will come up with our ways to increase their occupancy rates,’’ he said."
"the international monetary fund forecasts that ethiopia’s domestic debt will decline while its external debt rises. the final version of the international monetary fund’s (imf) article iv for the past fiscal year indicated that the country external debt grew at a higher percentage than the past few years, while domestic debt will decline in the current fiscal year.
the report, issued in the middle of the week, stated that the country’s external debt compared with its gdp will be 33.1 percent. this is an increase of two percent compared with the 2016/17 fiscal year.
the imf has raised concerns about the nation’s external growth. however, its external debt growth has not risen significantly over the past three years and has not passed 30 percent.
the imf’s statement indicates that ethiopia’s external debt will be 33.1 percent, which is slightly more than the estimated 30.4 percent last fiscal year. two years ago the country’s external debt was estimated at 30.7 percent and 30.3 percent in 2014/15.
the imf executive directors who appreciated the government’s efforts to expand exports, and increase private sector involvement in the economy, underlined that external imbalances and inadequate reserve buffers remain a key risk, and urged the authorities to maintain determined policy actions to control external borrowing.
the estimation for this year, is the second largest move after 2014/15, according to the report. the imf statement indicated that the country’s external debt compared with the gdp has increased to 30.3 percent from 25.8 percent the preceding year.
the imf projection indicated that the country’s public debt which includes domestic debt will be 59 percent of the gdp for the 2017/18 fiscal year, which was estimated to be 56.9 percent in the past fiscal year.
the report projected that domestic debt will decrease compared with the past year. it would be the first incident after years of stagnation if the imf projection comes true. the domestic debt has been growing steadily in previous years. a small growth rate of domestic debt is part of the target set by the government to keep inflation to single digits.
the imf report stated that the domestic debt would 25.9 percent of the gdp, which is a decrease compared with the 2016/17 fiscal year.
the directors commended the restrictive public sector borrowing policy to contain external debt and imports while protecting pro-poor spending, the devaluation of the currency to regain competitiveness, and the tight monetary policy to rein in inflation.
gross domestic investment will also decrease for the third year in the row. the article iv consultation of imf indicated that the domestic investment will stand at 36.4 percent which is a decrease of 0.2 percent compared with 2016/17. the gross domestic investment has decreased for the past two years and will continue during the current year from its heyday in 2014/15 when it was 39.4 percent.
private investment will continue growing, while the public investment will slow down as has been the trend over the previous three years.
the country’s gross official reserve will show an improvement for the current year over the estimated 1.9 months of imports or usd 3.2 billion. the projection indicated that the gross official reserve will become two months or usd 3.67 billion, but this is lower than the standard of at least three months of imported goods.
it indicated that the executive directors welcomed plans to improve the management and oversight of public enterprises, including undertaking audits for some large state-owned enterprises (soes). “public-private partnerships (ppps), long-term concessions, and privatization of soes could offer opportunities to fund critical infrastructure,” the report added. recently, the government secured a huge amount of hard currency from its sale of shares of the national tobacco enterprise to japan tobacco international at a cost of usd 434 million.
the directors also encouraged the authorities to continue to monitor the npls of the national development bank (development bank of ethiopia, npl reached over 25 percent) and to shift its current funding mechanism to a less distortive system.
the statement that imf released on january 17 indicated that the directors urged implementation of the action plan to further strengthen the aml/cft (anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism) framework.
imf welcomed the birr devaluation by 15 percent against other major hard currencies. in the report the directors noted that a more flexible exchange rate would help preserve competitiveness and foster export diversification, and recommended eliminating exchange restrictions."
"a recent drought, poor economic conditions, massive migration to cities like addis ababa, hawassa and nazareth, along with parents who place a low priority on education have contributed to over 493,000 students from southern nations nationalities and peoples’ region (snnpr) dropping out of school this fiscal year.
according to information that capital obtained from the snnpr education bureau 436,000 primary and 56,943 high school students dropped out or did not come to school at all.benchi magi and south omo zones had some of the highest dropout rates as 4.6 million students between first and eighth grade or 9.7 percent of the youth population did not attend school when it began in the middle of september. from this figure 625,754 high school students or 9.2 percent of the student population left their schools.
sixty percent of the students who dropped out of primary school were girls. among high school age students 60 percent of the dropouts were males.
there is a school feeding program which provides breakfast and lunch to students. this is funded by the world food program, the federal government and the snnpr educational bureau. the budget for this program is 78 million birr. this has helped slightly decrease the dropout rate to 13 percent in 2016/17.
some say that regions should offer free education during the evening hours and more economic assistance for parents to reduce the dropout rate.
one expert who requested anonymity said:
“many of these students have parents who are farmers or have tough economic situations so their children are expected to help work during the day and it is hard for them to attend school. if there were classes at night it could help alleviate the situation or if parents were able to earn more money from farming and side jobs they wouldn’t feel the need to use their children as a means of economic assistance and would instead send them to school which would bring them more long term benefits.”
meseret bezu, snnpr education bureau development plan director disagrees with this, she says the night shift is not a major solution to reducing school dropout rates.
“we are working on school feeding to assist parents in providing food for their children. we are opening schools near their home which are equipped with libraries and laboratories so as a government we need encourage students to attend school every day to give them a better education. night school is not our top priority agenda,” she said."
"the past couple of years have been tough for african countries in the business of trade, a statistics report by united nations conference on trade and development shows. according to the report, a slowdown in trade was particularly evident in merchandise exports, which fell by 10.5 percent. decreasing volumes of goods loaded in seaports for international shipment and falling foreign direct investment receipts also illustrated the challenges, the findings show. nevertheless, for the region, gdp grew by a modest 1.7 percent.
other factors for africa’s less than satisfactory trade sector includes the fact that the sector remains characterized by low product diversification and high dependency on raw materials compared with other regions of the world.
the report also shows that decreasing commodity prices in recent years have led to deteriorating terms of trade. this deterioration was reflected in large trade deficits for manufactured goods, which were not outweighed by trade surpluses for primary products. consequently, africa ran a merchandise trade deficit, as their percentage of exports, was much higher than other developing regions.
other statistics, available in the report, indicate some favorable trends for african economies. since june 2016, for example, the unctad commodity price index has been increasing year-on-year. the current account deficit of many african economies stabilized in 2016 and stopped rising. looking at demographic trends, the proportion of people of working age in africa is expected to grow rapidly, yielding a demographic dividend and a positive effect on labor supply. the same favorable trends have been seen in 2017.
the report also illustrates the importance of trans-continental and intra-region trade and how they vary across continents. in 2016, the exchange of goods between china, the united states of america and germany amounted to almost usd 1 trillion – 6 percent of world merchandise trade.
in the same year, 69 percent of the european exports remained within europe and 59 percent of the asian exports, in asia. by contrast, for northern america, latin america and the caribbean and for africa, most exports were delivered to economies in other continents than that of the exporter.
unctad’s report referred to as a statistics handbook provides a coherent overview of trends worldwide and novel summary analyses of countries, regions and sectors.
according to unctad’s deputy secretary-general isabelle durant “reliable statistical information is essential to support, evaluate and guide policy choices for all nations, and notably developing countries, providing them with tools that are not always easy for them to produce. such tools are indispensable, both for their national economies and development, and to better integrate them into the global economy.”"
"the ministry of trade (mot) has promised frustrated home buyers from access real estate that they will settle their dilemma soon, but they did not give a specific time.
a week ago the main committee of access home buyers visited the ministry office to discuss why it has taken so long to find a solution to their problem. since they appeared without an appointment they did not have enough time to express their concerns, while the bekele bulado (phd), minister of mot, agreed to meet them on wednesday january 10 at the mot hall, according to sources.
the committee and bekele met on wednesday. sources told capital that in the meeting the minister promised to solve the problem as soon as possible.
the committee members representing home buyers at 19 sites claimed that the ministry is the body that should give a solution to their case, according to sources who attended the meeting.
“bekele also told the committee members to follow the case as usual and insist that other relevant government offices like the city government speed up the case and provide a solution,” sources told capital.
the audit report carried out by the audit services corporation and submitted to the ministry of trade on april 7, 2017 indicated that the company had collected 1.3 billion birr. the major share or 1.16 billion birr came from home buyers.
no one who gave access money for a home actually received one even though the company promised to transfer the houses five years ago. this eventually led to the prime minster promising the 2,500 home buyers a solution at the meeting. the home buyers sued access and affiliates and the courts mostly ruled in their favor.
a few weeks ago, the home buyers committee wrote a letter for the second time within a few months asking to meet with the pm. in their letter they complained that even though the main committee was formed by executive order of the pm and some actions were taken, the 2,500 home buyers have not gotten any solution. they begged the pm to meet with them to explain their problems.
the joint letter signed by mebrat woldetensai, board chair of access real estate, and aklog seyum, chair of the main committee for the home buyers that was issued in early november 2017 asked the attorney general about how the legal process was going since they had requested that access real estate be held accountable for their actions.
in another letter signed on october 23, 2017 a separate group of home buyers also asked the pm for support. they asked to be compensated for what they paid to access real estate. “we are not represented by the main committee of home buyers and the proposals tabled by the committee do not represent us,” the letter signed by bekele woldemichael, who was mentioned as chair of the committee of 168 people who purchased homes from access and pacific link, said.
they asked the government to involve them in any decision it makes. they also wanted the government to form an independent caretaker administration and board to get their home. “if our request is granted we will stop the court process and work with the government’s decision,” the letter reads.
aklog seyoum, chair of the main committee, agreed with the claim of the other group of home buyers about the representation. “the main committee is working for the home buyers who gave legally authenticated representation to find a solution in an organized manner, but there is a group who filed a case at the court and got a final decision from the court,” he told capital.
the group mentioned as a separate committee did not get representation from the main committee, according to aklog.
“we are looking for an administrative and political decision from the government but they preferred to go the court,” he elaborated.
“we are waiting for a solution supported by the government, they have a right to go on the way that they prefer,” aklog argued."
"occupancy rates drop to 15 percent after discussions between the amhara cultural tourism bureau and the commercial bank of ethiopia the seventeen members of the bahir dar hotel owners association are being allowed to extend their bank loan payments for a year after they were hit by a decreasing number of visitors.the hotels had borrowed the funds for construction and expansion projects.
when hotel owners complained to the tourism bureau about the low hotel occupancy rates, the commercial bank of ethiopia and other private banks only required the hotels to pay off interest on their loans. they will have to restart paying off the principal at the start of next ethiopian year.
on october 9th, 2016, following the unrest in amhara region, the ruling ethiopian people’s revolutionary democratic front declared a six-month state of emergency, which was extended by four months at the end of march last year. since that time there have been violent incidents in the area.
the unrest and the state of emergency are the primary reason fewer tourists and other visitors have traveled to bahir dar. this has affected occupancy rates of hotels. last fiscal year 880,000 tourists visited ethiopia. that is a decrease by 50,000 compared to the previous year.
mulugeta bazen, president of the bahir dar hotel association told capital that over the last 18 months, hotel occupancy rates have been below 15 percent.
“my hotel has 70 rooms and before the unrest most of them were occupied. now between one and 5 people come and reserve the rooms. there are not as many tourists as before and more than ten new hotel projects in the pipeline have stopped construction due to poor market conditions.”
he added that the hotel room occupancy was returning to normal last september but the recent university protests caused many local and international tourists not to visit the city.
“as we all know hotels employ many people, but if we don’t have long lasting peace in our area, it is hard for the hotels to earn money’’ he said.
bahir dar is a major conference site in ethiopia, it ranks fourth next to addis ababa, adama and hawassa. tourists who come to see lake tana, lalibella, tis abay and other monasteries and churches in gojam, often book hotels in the city.
last year the addis ababa hotel owners association wrote a letter to the prime minister’s office and the ministry of culture and tourism asking that all hotels in addis be exempt from profit tax and loan interest this fiscal year. they argued that protests caused low occupancy rates and reduced income."
"the addis ababa land holding registration and information agency had plans to audit nearly 600,000 parcels in the city by 2022. however, in the last three years only 160,000 parcels have been audited.
some of the reasons for the slow performance include poor coordination by the land management document and authentication office, the land banking compensation payment office and the plan office.
out of the 20 woredas in the city, the bureau has audited 53,000 parcels. land holding certificates have been given to individuals and entities but over 33,000 parcels are still undergoing disputes because of lack of information.
the agency has 800 staff to complete the audit; however sources told capital that this number should be doubled.
currently giving out land holding certificates takes more than one year. the goal was for this to take two weeks. auditing one district has taken more than eight months, the goal is for this to be accomplished in less than three months.
“apart from the poor coordination of the work, we don’t have the necessary labor and beyond that there is high turnover of the staff due to the low salary. the city administration has studied a new strategy to retain workers, however nothing has been applied so far,” a source said.
“we have less than four years to audit the entire addis ababa region, and to retake land that is occupied illegally, but with the way things are going it could take over 10 years. so far we have only covered 20 of the 117 woredas of the city,” a source said.
during the current land auditing, the agency set a tolerance limit from three up to 14 percent for the land between 250 square meters and 3,500 square meters. if the person holds more land than the tolerance limit the administration will take the land and use it for lease auctions or other development work.
the pervious proclamation of the city stated that all land that is held after may 2005 will be dealt with in the new land lease policy.
the growing population and limited land supply has challenged the land market in addis which recently fetched up from 10,000 up to 350,000 birr for the purchase of one square meter of land.
the city administration of addis ababa is concerned about the development of an adequate drainage system, the renovation of slum areas, and the construction of modern roads and infrastructure. for this reason, the land board favors projects which promote social service investment or have welfare benefits, such as those in health and education.
at present, acquiring land is an arduous process and lease prices, particularly within addis ababa, are expensive. government officials respond that the price is set by auction and investors are welcome, even encouraged, to set up their project outside the capital. this has only led investors to shop around for land just outside the addis regional administration."
"last wednesday, siraj fegessa, minister of defense and secretariat of the national security council, gave a one hour press conference at military officers club where he provided an update on the unrest along somali, oromia border region.
he said that so far somali police have not arrested a person suspected of being involved in a recent border clash between the two regions.
in ethiopia’s somali region, 29 arrest warrants were handed out but only 12 people have been captured. in oromia 26 arrest warrants have been issued but only three are in custody, siraj said.
“we are not happy with what we see as slow action being taken by the two regions to capture people suspected of violence,” he said.
in february and march, hundreds were reported to have been killed in the southern oromia district of negeleborena.
ethnic oromos allege that the liyu police of somalia region, which has previously been accused by rights groups of human rights violations, is behind the current attacks.
the somali regional government has however rejected the allegations and charged that senior officials in the oromia government were sympathizers of the oromo liberation front, which is categorized as a terrorist organization by the ethiopian government.
currently the border, which is made up of nearly 60 weredas is being controlled by the federal police in an attempt to calm down the situation.
“we have observed an unstable environment in around 19 universities in amhara, tigray and oromia. in these schools over 1,000 students were dismissed for violating the discipline code. thanks to the elders and peace loving people there is a more stable atmosphere along the borders, the situation is more stable and everything is back to normal,” he said.
he added that over 1,000 guns were confiscated along the border in places like togo chale, and metema as they were being smuggled over the border.
he also said new regulations are being prepared to stop illegal ownership of guns.
journalists asked him how many people have died in the recent unrest, they also asked about allegations that solders had taken heavy handed actions against protesters and if defense forces included enough ethnicities.
“we are still trying to determine how many people and solders died in the protests, as soon as we know we will inform the public. as the pm said before we are looking at our actions and will find out if defense forces took inappropriate actions.”
“we believe we have the right proportion of ethnicities but we will continue to work hard in this area,” he added. he went on to say that long lasting peace depends on addressing the concerns of the people."
"according to a save the children situation report that came out in december, levels of humanitarian need are extremely high given that most displaced people from the armed conflict along the somali/oromia border, are already in drought affected zones.
according the over view of the report on the situation, displaced people live in approximately 100 sites in addition to those in host communities.
it also states that displaced people in many locations are frustrated that numerous assessments have been carried out without humanitarian assistance. “the government therefore urges humanitarian agencies not to carry out verification assessment exercises unless they can ensure humanitarian assistance follows immediately as the current coverage is very little and a vast majority of internally displaced people are not receiving assistance in the ongoing collective response,” it reads.
according to a recent multi agency team assessment looking at people internally displaced through the conflict. as assessment of humanitarian needs, vulnerability and potential risks clearly indicated the need for life-saving interventions for food security, emergency shelters, wash, health, nutrition, education and child protection needs. the findings of the assessment also show that cumulative effects of the drought and conflict-induced displacement is adding further stress to food reserves and water sources.
staring in september 2017, armed conflict broke out between ethnic oromo and somalia inhabitants along the somali/oromia regional border. although no official statistics are available on the number of people dead or seriously injured on both sides, many women and children and elderly are believed to have been affected, save the children says. in many kebele’s and villages that were attacked, houses were burned, assets and personal belongings looted, and community assets destroyed, including looting of schools, health centers and mill houses.
the recent report by ethiopia’s national disaster risk management and food security sector estimated that 929,000 people; 600,000 in oromia and 329,000 in somalia, have been displaced due to the border conflict between the two ethnic groups that started in april 2017 and escalated in late september 2017.
according to the humanitarian agency, there are reportedly a significant number of malnourished children, pregnant girls due to child marriage, children with physical and mental disabilities, physical injuries, separated and unaccompanied children, and children with deteriorating physiological situations. most of school age children of displaced communities are not attending school since there is no established emergency school at many of the displaced people sites."
"the addis ababa city administration trade bureau (aatb) announced that only 122,752 businesses have renewed their licenses out of the existing 262,688. there is only one week left until the renewal period ends. starting from july 9 the bureau asked business owners to bring clearances from the revenue and customs bureau by january 8 or face penalties.
addis ketama, which has the largest number of business, has only renewed 13,178 licenses from a possible 35,000, bole renewed 15,858 from 42,000. in the other ten sub cities, yeka, lideta, and arada 53 percent of the 60,000 business were renewed.
recently the government increased the presumptive tax, estimating the tax based on the number of products and transactions in a day, for the first time in six years. by 2020 presumptive taxes are expected to reach 17 percent of gdp. however, tax collection has remained stagnant. to achieve this goal the government is conducting a study to expand the tax base and collect more taxes.
however business people have been repeatedly complaining to the government that the increase in taxes has not taken into account their actual transactions. aatb and customs officials maintain that business people still need to renew their licenses regardless of issues they have with the presumptive tax.
berahanu tegengne, trade licensing director at addis ababa trade bureau told media on december 22, that the bureau is working on a license renewal proclamation and that each business must renew their licenses even if they have complaints with the revenue and customs authority.
he added that last year 13,692 licenses were given out which is 1,000 less compared to the previous year. however, during the same period 27,116 businesses entered into the market.
high rent prices, poor business planning, less support for entrepreneurs, and lack of a tax holiday are some of the reasons businesses have struggled in ethiopia which is ranked 161st out of 190 countries on ease of doing business.
the addis ababa trade bureau (aatb), recently assigned mesfin assefa (former mayor of legatfo) as director."
"the sugar corporation awarded a procurement of 100,000 metric tons of sugar for the dubai based supplier, al khaleej sugar on friday december 1.
the company which is familiar to the ethiopian market will transport the product up to djibouti port through january.
the sugar shortage has not been alleviated with local production so the government has imported 70,000 metric tons of sugar recently.
in the recent bid, though the invitation to short listed companies; five importers participated on november 24 hoping they would be picked to import the product as soon as possible.
the companies who bided are ed and f man, tereos commodities, agro corp, sucden, and al khaleej. sucden is the company that supplied the 70,000 metric tons that was procured before the end of the past budget year to fill the gap that occurred when sugar factories shut down for maintenance at the beginning of the current budget year.
in the latest procurement al khaleej won the bid by offering 496.91 usd per ton up to the djibouti port or fob of 460.91 usd at the port of the initial point. the company is expected to supply the sweat from uae or pakistan and the payment will be settled within 12 months.
prime minister hailemariam dessalegn recently said that the import of sugar will be continued until the shortage is alleviated.
several sugar projects commenced in the first growth and transformation plan, but none of them commenced commercial production.
in the last couple of months the sugar shortage was visibly observed in the capital and regional towns and the price of the product skyrocketed on the black-market. in his latest press briefing the pm apologized to the general public for the incident and he promised that the government will continue importing.
the corporation has plans to cut sugar imports as of the budget year and it has unsuccessfully to export sugar to kenya."
"the palestinian government, which strongly opposed the us plan to move its embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem thanked ethiopia and other 14 members of the security council namely: russia, france, britain, china, sweden, bolivia, uruguay, italy, egypt, ukraine, japan, kazakhstan, and senegal for their principled stand and deep compliment to the united nations secretary general antonio gutierrez, for condemning the announcement of the us president.
nasri abujah, ambassador of the state of palestine to ethiopia, kenya and uganda said on the international day of solidarity with the palestinian people, celebrated at the economic commission of africa (eca) on december 12, said peace cannot be achieved in the middle east without a full sovereign and independent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital.
“the president of the united states of america did not realize the fact that we palestinians have a deep rooted history in east jerusalem: deeper than the roots of olive and orange trees! and mr. trump will never be able to erase that fact.”
“mr. trump, you based your decision on the facts of jerusalem for few years, such as the presence of the israeli prime minister office and the israeli knesset, to give israel this right. if you have wondered in the neighborhoods and streets (like khan al-zayt, the old city, wadialjoz and the gates of jerusalem) you would have discovered that it belonged to the palestinians.” he added that the recent decision will harm the ongoing peace process.
“this reckless decision sends a dangerous message that will resonate worldwide. it undermines the standing of the international system, including the united nations. it also tells countries that they can dictate realities by force and violations of the international law. this will unleash a new era of violence and disregard of international law worldwide’’ the ambassador further added.
suleiman dedefo, director of middle east at the ethiopian ministry of foreign affairs said that ethiopia will work with the un and au to resolve the dispute among israel and palestine.
the international legal and diplomatic status of jerusalem is unresolved. legal scholars disagree on how to resolve the israeli–palestinian dispute about it under international law. many united nations (un) member states formally adhere to the united nations proposal that jerusalem should have an international status.
the major dispute revolves around the legal status of east jerusalem, while an agreement exists regarding future israeli presence in west jerusalem. de jure, the majority of un member states and most international organisations do not recognize israel’s ownership of east jerusalem, which came under its control after the 1967 six-day war, or its 1980 jerusalem law proclamation, which declared a “complete and united” jerusalem as the capital of israel. as a result, foreign embassies are generally located in tel aviv and its suburbs."
"the government of djibouti has decided to reduce the price of service at doraleh multipurpose port (dmp), the biggest ever sea port facility in the gulf of aden. they are able to reduce their price because they have modernized services and thus minimized operating costs according to wahib daher aden, ceo of dmp. 
dmp was inaugurated may 24 by president ismail omar guelleh of djibouti and other top government officials from the region. it is capable of handing many cargo vessels at the same time.
during the press conference held at dmp compound, wahib daher aden, announced the surprising port service charge reduction.
“i have very good news for you,” he said when he was asked about the price from a journalist that attended the press conference.
“the government of djibouti has decided to decrease the prices of the dmp,” he told an ethiopian media crew.
“so really there is a big decrease, it has been decided by the government of djibouti and every forwarder and client in ethiopia will get a notice,” wahib added.
he explained that the decrease was applied to every cargo type including general cargo, vehicles, and dry bulk.
experts said that it is a huge decrease. the ceo said that the government wanted to cut some of the costs from the operation at the port so it would remain sustainable.
he said that some of prices have gone down as much as 45 percent. in general the reduction is between 20 to 45 percent, according to the ceo.
he said that the new port will never be congested since the discharge is undertaken by the port owner itself.
“it is easy for the vessels and truck drivers to just come to the yard and load the cargo,” the ceo added.
the port, which is considered as one of the most advanced in africa, was completed in march this year and received the first vessel in mid april.
dmp, which is under port of djibouti s.a. (pdsa), targets boosting the logistics activity in the region. it has consumed usd 590 million.
at the inauguration, saad omar guelleh, general manager of pdsa, said that the new 690 hectare facility is equipped with ultra-modern facilities that can accommodate 100,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt) vessels.
the project was started in 2015, and jointly financed by djibouti ports and free zones authority (dpfza) and china merchant holding (cmhc), which bought a 23.5 percent share of pdsa about four and half years ago. the state of the art port equipment was all manufactured by the chinese firm zpmc.
the geographical location of doraleh multipurpose port provides a naturally deep large quay and 6 berths (to reach 15 berths in the second phase) at 16 to 18 meters in the first phase. the dmp will serve all conventional cargo vessels and related services. it will be linked to rail transport developing an integrated transport and economic corridor.
dmp is able to process 220,000 teu and 8.2 million tons of non-containerized goods. so far the port has given service to 220 vessels and 1.7 million tons of cargo since it commenced operation about six months ago.
dmp has four separate terminals for handling containers, ro/ro, break bulk and bulk cargos."
"the ethiopian revenue and customs authority (erca) warned tax payers that it will implement an aggressive audit operation and intelligence service because it is disappointed by the amount of vat refunds and declarations of losses.
authority officials met with large tax payers and stakeholders at different events to talk about the issue.
director of the authority, moges balcha met with the media and expressed concern that some tax payers are declaring losses or no income on their annual income tax report and vat refund form.
“the authority is concerned about the new trend because it is affecting the government’s income and the economy,” he added.
this development is unhealthy moges said.
at the discussion held at the large tax payers office (lto) about a week ago the management of erca stated that the issue has to be corrected.
they said the authority will take legal action against those who try to evade the tax.
erca’s four month evaluation indicated that there is a difference between addis ababa and federal tax payers.
“our evaluation for the first four months of the budget year indicated that there is gap mainly on legality in terms of tax payment,” moges told media.
“to do so we have strengthened the intelligence operation and investigation audit,” he added.
the officials said that they are disappointed in the result registered in the past period.
experts at erca told capital the tax payers under lto have been also involved in tax evasion.
even though they are very few (large tax payers) some of them are involved in illegal activities and tax evasion, according to sources at erca.
there are only 1,100 tax payers followed by lto, while some of them have not considered the damage of tax evasion on their businesses, experts at erca said.
the large tax payers cover 45 percent of the tax collection.
from 16,000 tax payers who declared their annual income 63 percent came up with tax payments, and 28 percent declared loss or bankruptcy.
“it does not mean that business is always profitable, loss happens and that is also supported by the law. however, the issue is it is real or fake,” the director said.
he added that erca has finished undertaking an investigation on those who have declared a loss.
“we will give priority to the tax payers that have declared losses,” he strongly said.
in relation to vat on average from 17,500 vat registered businesses that report every month 45 percent request a vat refund.
the balance of vat collectors stated that they did not undertake business in the period.
“because of the economic growth of the country it indicates that there are phony reports or refunds from the tax payers,” the director said.
erca claimed that illegal receipts are issued for the claim of vat refunds. it indicates that there is unhealthy tax system from the business community, according to erca head, who assigned for the post recently.
so far erca has prosecuted or is in legal proceedings against 81members of the business community who use illegal receipts and are involved in other types of fraud.
“we will continue to take similar action against those involved in illegal activity,” moges said.
in the budget year 199.11 billion birr is expected to be collected from taxes and related sources according to the amended budget for the year. to accomplish this erca has increased its goal to 230 billion birr.
erca planned to collect 72 billion birr in first quarter of the 2017/18 budget year, however they only collected 63 billion.
“we have to change the current trend to register the expected achievement,” he added.
illegal or phony receipts are the major challenges according to experts.
erca planned to increase tax revenue to 17.2 percent from the total gdp at the end of the current five year plan that will be end in 2020.
the current tax collection is 12.5 percent of the gdp. this is considered weak compared to other regional countries, according to the international monetary fund and other international partners.
“when we see the current trend it indicates that it is difficult to achieve the projection, so law enforcement has to be strong,” the director said.
“however, the current challenge is not out of control,” he said.
“we will implement the legal operation to settle the evasion,” he concluded."
